t3_gj5zh4,Unpopular Opinion or just Objective Fact? Dollar Cost Averaging is simply a psychological tool and will (on average) cost you money,"1st: this entire post is from the perspective that you have the capital available to you on Day 1, and that it’s sitting in cash. It is not from the perspective of you’re earning the cash over time (ex:. 401k contributions over your lifetime)  
Before everyone, loses it on me immediately, I actually think the psychological gains from DCA are actually worth the average loss you’d take. But it doesn’t change the fact that DCA as a methodology compared to strategy of dumping all your intended investment into an asset from Day 1 is inherently break-even (at best) or a net-loss (at-worst)  - ON AVERAGE.

  
**If you start from the assumption that the stock market tends to rise over time, waiting to put money into a stock pick is costing you money.**  Sometimes you’ll “win” and the stock will go down over that interval. Other times you’ll “lose” and the price will go up over that interval. But over many stock picks and repeat trials, on-average DCA loses more than it wins (simply due to the first sentence of this paragraph). 

  
Now, psychologically, DCA really helps. I can attest from personal experience. Here are the basic scenarios you have:  


* **Scenario #1: DCA &amp; stock goes up during period you’re buying**:
   * Psychology: You feel like you made a good pick. You’re happy. You’re not overly concerned w/ the gains you missed if you’d invested all the capital at Day 1 because you’re happy with your skill picking out a good stock
* **Scenario #2: DCA &amp; stock goes down during the period you’re buying**:
   * Psychology: You’re a bit disappointed, but you’re also comforted that you didn’t load up on Day 1. Sometimes, you feel excited, even great, that you’re now getting an even better deal on this stock than your original buy price
* **Scenario #3: All-in at Day 1  &amp; stock goes up during what would've been DCA buying period:** 
   * Psychology: You’re happy. Though not much more happy than if you’d done Scenario #1.
* **Scenario #4: All-in at Day 1  &amp; stock does down during what would’ve been DCA buying**
   * Psychology: You’re distraught. At best, upset with yourself that you mistimed your buy and left money on the table. At worst, considering panic selling. 

As you can see, in both DCA scenarios you feel pretty good about yourself. You certainly aren’t kicking yourself too hard, and if you’re in a hole it feels like one you can still climb out of.  Compare to the “All-in” scenarios, the pain of the loss aversion in scenario #4 outweighs the extra satisfaction you get in Scenario #3.

  
**In summary / TLDR:** if we were robots without emotion, and if you’re faced with the decision many times throughout your life (so you get the benefit on “on average”), you would not engage in DCA.  ",investing,unpopular opinion objective fact dollar cost averaging simply psychological tool average cost money, entire post perspective capital available day sitting cash perspective earning cash time contribution lifetime everyone loses immediately actually think psychological gain dca actually worth average loss take change fact dca methodology compared strategy dumping intended investment asset day inherently break even best net loss worst average start assumption stock market tends rise time waiting put money stock pick costing money sometimes win stock interval time lose price interval many stock pick repeat trial average dca loses win simply due first sentence paragraph psychologically dca really help attest personal experience basic scenario scenario dca stock period buying psychology feel like made good pick happy overly concerned gain missed invested capital day happy skill picking good stock scenario dca stock period buying psychology bit disappointed also comforted load day sometimes feel excited even great getting even better deal stock original buy price scenario day stock would dca buying period psychology happy though much happy done scenario scenario day stock would dca buying psychology distraught best upset mistimed buy left money table worst considering panic selling see dca scenario feel pretty good certainly kicking hard hole feel like one still climb compare scenario pain loss aversion scenario outweighs extra satisfaction get scenario summary tldr robot without emotion faced decision many time throughout life get benefit average would engage dca,unpopular opinion objective fact dollar cost averaging simply psychological tool average cost money  entire post perspective capital available day sitting cash perspective earning cash time contribution lifetime everyone loses immediately actually think psychological gain dca actually worth average loss take change fact dca methodology compared strategy dumping intended investment asset day inherently break even best net loss worst average start assumption stock market tends rise time waiting put money stock pick costing money sometimes win stock interval time lose price interval many stock pick repeat trial average dca loses win simply due first sentence paragraph psychologically dca really help attest personal experience basic scenario scenario dca stock period buying psychology feel like made good pick happy overly concerned gain missed invested capital day happy skill picking good stock scenario dca stock period buying psychology bit disappointed also comforted load day sometimes feel excited even great getting even better deal stock original buy price scenario day stock would dca buying period psychology happy though much happy done scenario scenario day stock would dca buying psychology distraught best upset mistimed buy left money table worst considering panic selling see dca scenario feel pretty good certainly kicking hard hole feel like one still climb compare scenario pain loss aversion scenario outweighs extra satisfaction get scenario summary tldr robot without emotion faced decision many time throughout life get benefit average would engage dca
t3_gjcr8n,"[LATimes] Uber offers to buy Grubhub, plans to sell $900M in bonds","https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-05-13/uber-grubhub-bond-sale

&gt; Uber Technologies Inc. has made an offer to acquire Grubhub Inc., a move that could combine two of the largest food-delivery apps in the U.S. as the novel coronavirus — and the stay-at-home orders meant to limit the virus’ spread — drives a surge in demand, according to people familiar with the matter.
&gt; 
&gt; The companies are in talks about a deal and could reach an agreement as soon as this month, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter isn’t public. Deliberations are ongoing, and talks could still fall through, the people said.
&gt; 
&gt; Although neither company confirmed the talks, they both said they’re always looking for opportunities to provide value to their businesses.
&gt; 
&gt; On Wednesday, Uber brought a $900-million bond sale. That’s up from a planned $750-million sale, which the company said may be used for acquisitions, among other general corporate purposes. The five-year notes, which can’t be bought back for two years, will yield 7.5%, said people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be named discussing a private transaction.
&gt; 
&gt; Grubhub, founded in 2004, is the oldest of the major food delivery companies in the United States. In recent years, competition from DoorDash Inc. and Uber has squeezed Grubhub’s profit margins. The pandemic is adding more pressure, forcing Grubhub to withdraw its 2020 financial guidance last month. Uber pulled its forecast too, and said a plan to turn a quarterly adjusted profit this year would be delayed until 2021.
&gt; 
&gt; As part of a series of cost-cutting movies, Uber said last week that it is ending its food-delivery operations in seven countries where the service has proved unpopular. Those markets represented 1% of Uber Eats’ gross bookings and 4% of the business’ adjusted loss before interest, taxes and other expenses for the first quarter of 2020, the company said. Uber’s ride-hailing business has been hammered by the global pandemic, but in the U.S. and other developed markets, delivering meals has helped the San Francisco company drive sales as people mostly stay at home.
&gt; 
&gt; Food delivery remains largely unprofitable. That dynamic has led to much speculation about potential consolidation in the industry. DoorDash, which is privately held and backed by SoftBank Group Corp., is the most popular in the U.S., followed by Grubhub and Uber. Any merger between the major apps could draw antitrust scrutiny. Together, Uber and Grubhub could account for 55% of the market, according to Wedbush Securities.
&gt; 
&gt; A deal “would help consolidate the U.S. online food delivery market and reduce cash burn,” Bloomberg Intelligence senior industry analyst Mandeep Singh wrote in a note Tuesday.
&gt; 
&gt; Meanwhile, these companies face calls from officials to improve conditions for their gig economy workers. California’s attorney general sued Uber and ride-hailing rival Lyft Inc. last week, alleging they’re in violation of a state law designed to give their workers the benefits due to employees. A loss in that case could set a precedent that increases costs for the companies and raises further questions about their ability to be profitable.
&gt; 
&gt; Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), who heads the House antitrust subcommittee, said the proposed deal underscores the urgency for a moratorium on most mergers, an idea supported by other Democrats. “Uber is a notoriously predatory company that has long denied its drivers a living wage. Its attempt to acquire Grubhub — which has a history of exploiting local restaurants through deceptive tactics and extortionate fees — marks a new low in pandemic profiteering,” Cicilline said in a statement.
&gt; 
&gt; Restaurant advocates also said they were worried about the potential consequences of an Uber-Grubhub combination. “It’s extremely concerning,” said Andrew Rigie, executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance, a group that represents restaurants in New York. Grubhub and its Seamless division already dominate the city, Rigie said, “and they use their leverage and market share at the expense of local restaurants.”
&gt; 
&gt; Bradley Tusk, an early Uber advisor who has since sold his stake in the company, said that if the policies cities are considering take hold long term, “it may be that consolidation is the only way to have a couple of market players that can survive at all.” Otherwise, food delivery could end up looking like the costly ride-hailing rivalry between Uber and Lyft, Tusk said.
&gt; 
&gt; “Uber should have found a way to buy or kill Lyft a lot earlier,” Tusk said. “The unit economics of ride sharing would be a lot easier if they had, and I think they’re trying to learn that lesson now with the acquisition of Grubhub.”",investing,latimes uber offer buy grubhub plan sell bond,uber technology inc made offer acquire grubhub inc move could combine two largest food delivery apps

t3_gjggts,The case for Uber,"Uber should generate around $12b in revenue this year. It is fair to say that they will probably burn through at least $10b. Investors have 2 main issues with Uber right now 1. Their ridiculous cash burn. 2. Their end game. 

1. This is short term and shouldn’t be a problem for more than a few years. Before covid Uber was suggesting positive EBITA by years end.

2. So let’s first look at a simple bear case for Uber. Uber is in a hyper competitive market that is really in its infancy. There is no doubt that self driving cars are rapidly approaching and with companies such as Google and Tesla who needs Uber in the long run? Uber’s tech can be easily replaced where as self driving cars cannot.

Ok compelling - why I’m a bull. Uber will be the gig economy. 

Sure, companies such as google and Tesla have technology that Uber cannot match. But here is why that doesn’t matter so much:

- Uber holds tremendous value in terms of data and brand recognition that makes them a prime candidate for a partnership. They’ve already formed a partnership with Toyota for example. A company such as waymo entering this new space would take on a whole lot less risk if they partnered with Uber. 

- In the future a much smaller percentage of Uber’s revenue will come from ride-share. Think about it, Uber is in a great place to make acquisitions. We have seen it this week with talks to buy grubhub. There are plenty of companies out there with synergies to Uber. There are already well over 100 gig economy companies that Uber can take aim at - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gig_economy_companies

In summary I see Uber as the future for all things Gig. You want gig shipping - you go Uber, you want gig work (Fiverr right now) you go Uber, you want your house cleaned you go Uber, you want your dog taken for a fucking walk you go Uber.

&amp;#x200B;

* Powell says virus poses lasting harm, more may need to be done
* Federal savings plan delays transfer to fund with China stocks

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-12/asia-stocks-to-open-lower-after-u-s-retreat-markets-wrap?srnd=premium&amp;sref=VyUXtO60](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-12/asia-stocks-to-open-lower-after-u-s-retreat-markets-wrap?srnd=premium&amp;sref=VyUXtO60)

Article on Bloomberg, by Rita Nazareth, Vildana Hajric, and Katherine Greifeld.

U.S. stocks tumbled to a three-week low after Jerome Powell warned economic risks from the virus are significant and tensions with China flared.

The S&amp;P 500 fell after the Federal Reserve chairman said the threat of a lasting downturn can deepen without additional government spending. Equities extended losses after a federal savings plan delayed moving funds into an index with Chinese stocks, adding to tensions stoked by President Donald Trump. Treasuries and the dollar advanced.

&amp;#x200B;

The stock weakness has the S&amp;P 500 headed for its worst week since March 20, the session before a furious 30% rally started. Equities tumbled Tuesday after health official Anthony Fauci warned the pandemic could worsen if states open too soon, and some Fed chiefs expressed concern the recession will be long. Famed investor Stanley Druckenmiller also hit sentiment, saying stocks are too high. David Tepper joined hate chorus Wednesday, saying only 1999 was more overvalued than the current market.

“It continues the theme from yesterday that the recovery will be slower and more uneven than what markets may currently be discounting,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “With the nice run off the lows, it makes sense to take some profits.”

Meanwhile, traders of fed funds futures pushed bets on a negative policy rate into next year. Powell acknowledged the speculation, but said such a move was not being considered -- though he stopped short of completely ruling the tool out as an option in the future.

“While Powell’s remarks paint a grim but realistic picture of the deep scarring of the virus on the U.S. economy, Fed watchers might find relief in the fact that Powell remains committed to deploy his remaining arsenal to the fullest extent as we continue to ride out the pandemic,” said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E\*Trade Financial. “This means their toolkit primarily relies on additional fiscal stimulus.”

Here are some key events coming up:

* U.S. weekly jobless claims data is due Thursday.
* China on Friday releases industrial production and retail sales data for April.

These are some of the main moves in markets:

## Stocks

* The S&amp;P 500 decreased 1.8% as of 1 p.m. New York time.
* The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 1.9%.
* The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 0.1%.

## Currencies

IMO, Prof. Damodaran is among the most informative and entertaining academics in finance. He's been doing regular updates on region, sector and category performance during this crisis. This is part 8. If you don't feel like nerding out for half an hour, here's the TL;DW: 

1. Commodities have taken a hit, particularly oil (for multiple reasons). Gold has done well, though perhaps not as well as expected. Bitcoin hasn't acted like gold.
2. Developing markets have underperformed developed markets during the crisis. Latin America has been hardest-hit.
3. The crisis has been selective/orderly in its damage dealt across sectors. Healthcare/Technology have fared well while Airlines/Oil/Finance have been hard hit.
4. Growth has outperformed value, continuing a decade-long trend, but in defiance of the overall market outperformance of value.
5. Large-cap has outperformed small-cap during the crisis, continuing a decade of outperformance, but in defiance of the overall trend.
6. Passive has outperformed active during a crisis across most categories, confounding one of the last remaining arguments for active investing.

The last point is the one I found most interesting. Even if you couldn't predict the crisis, you hypothetically could've gotten out before the worst or picked stocks less hit by the crisis. Yet a comparison of passive vs. active managed funds shows passive outperforming active even during a crisis. He expects this performance to accelerate the ongoing stampede of money out of active investing.

It’s hard to imagine challenging [Amazon](https://data.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN?view=franchise)’s dominance in the e-commence space, but the coronavirus pandemic just brought Canadian start-up [Shopify](https://data.cnbc.com/quotes/SHOP-CA?view=franchise) closer to being a serious threat to the trillion-dollar juggernaut.

The Ottawa-based company is giving small businesses a fighting chance by allowing them to quickly move operations online during the forced shutdowns.

Shopify shares have been on a tear, soaring 20% in May alone and pushing its 2020 gains to more than 90%. The company also surged past Royal Bank of Canada to become Canada’s largest company by market value. The stock, which went public in May 2015, hit another all-time high on Wednesday. 

“To me, it’s a company enabling small businesses to get more in line with what the post-pandemic economy looks like,” said Dan Nathan, principal of RiskReversal Advisors.

Shopify is experiencing a surge in sales and users during these unprecedented times. Last week, Shopify reported that its sales grew by 47% to $470 million in the first quarter and continued to accelerate in April, while new stores created on the platform grew 62% in a six-week period during the pandemic. 

“We are working as fast as we can to support our merchants by re-tooling our products to help them adapt to this new reality,” Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke said in a statement last week. “Our goal is that, because Shopify exists, more entrepreneurs and small businesses will get through this.”

One of the appeals for using Shopify is that companies can sell products on their own website, instead of listing items on an Amazon-style marketplace. This month, Shopify also announced a partnership with [Pinterest](https://data.cnbc.com/quotes/PINS?view=franchise), which allows merchants to share their products to about 350 million users.",investing,shopify hit record commerce enabler becomes one greatest stock story time,hard imagine challenging amazon dominance commence space coronavirus pandemic brought canadian start shopify closer serious threat trillion dollar juggernaut ottawa based company giving small business fighting chance allowing quickly move operation online forced shutdown shopify share tear soaring may alone pushing gain company also surged past royal bank canada become canada largest company market value stock went public may hit another time high wednesday company enabling small business get line post pandemic economy look like said dan nathan principal riskreversal advisor shopify experiencing surge sale user unprecedented time last week shopify reported sale grew million first quarter continued accelerate april new store created platform grew six week period pandemic working fast support merchant tooling product help adapt new reality shopify ceo tobi lutke said statement last week goal shopify exists entrepreneur small business get one appeal using shopify company sell product website instead listing item amazon style marketplace month shopify also announced partnership pinterest allows merchant share product million user,shopify hit record commerce enabler becomes one greatest stock story time hard imagine challenging amazon dominance commence space coronavirus pandemic brought canadian start shopify closer serious threat trillion dollar juggernaut ottawa based company giving small business fighting chance allowing quickly move operation online forced shutdown shopify share tear soaring may alone pushing gain company also surged past royal bank canada become canada largest company market value stock went public may hit another time high wednesday company enabling small business get line post pandemic economy look like said dan nathan principal riskreversal advisor shopify experiencing surge sale user unprecedented time last week shopify reported sale grew million first quarter continued accelerate april new store created platform grew six week period pandemic working fast support merchant tooling product help adapt new reality shopify ceo tobi lutke said statement last week goal shopify exists entrepreneur small business get one appeal using shopify company sell product website instead listing item amazon style marketplace month shopify also announced partnership pinterest allows merchant share product million user

* DraftKings (I don't know much about this market so I'm not going to comment on the viability)

Virgin Galactic and Nikola Motors have close to zero revenues (! revenues, not even profits !), strong competition, and I don't see any serious market advantage either company has. Virgin Galactic's history is just a whole sequence of failures and delays.

Why are these companies going through a backdoor IPO and not a ""front door"" one? Because noone wants to underwrite them!

t3_gjm8vm,What happened to oil deliveries from the May Futures?,"A recap of the negative prices seen in the May WTI oil futures: https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1lhy2h328jhpt/Inside-the-Biggest-Oil-Meltdown-in-History

Here's my understanding (please correct me if I'm wrong):

- On April 20, oil futures went negative. At one point, it was -$40.32 a barrel with a minimum contract of 1000 barrels. This means that someone holding this contract would PAY the buyer $40,320 to accept the 1000 barrels.
- The contracts have a stipulation that it must be delivered in Cushing, OK. Cushing, OK was very close to or was at storage capacity.

**My question here is why wouldn't the holder of the contract just refuse delivery instead of paying someone to accept the oil?** My understanding is that since a contract is a legal requirement, the holder of the contract would face severe legal action if they refused delivery, and thus, paying someone to take the oil off their hands is better than the alternative of legal action.

This leads to my next question: **What happens to those who purchased the contracts at -$40?** They couldn't possibly accept deliveries since Cushing, OK was at capacity. Will they face severe legal action?  

I'm likely missing something here, since the article goes on to say:

&gt;Of course, Trump was conflating his markets. The negative prices primarily stalked the May crude oil futures contract, not the markets for physical barrels. If the president was waiting for people to line up to help him fill the SPR with millions of barrels of free oil, says one trader who oversees physical oil trades in both the U.S. and Canadian markets, he’d still be waiting.

&gt;“I think the consensus among physical traders when we see crude futures get that chaotic and wonky is not to trade them. Sometimes it’s just better to sit things out.”

&gt; The futures market demonstrated no convergence with the physical market that day.

t3_gjlwi3,QE does not increase the money supply,"The purpose of QE in my opinion is the provide liquidity when the markets become tight like in March. The Fed becomes a bidder when no one else wants to bid on bonds. But when liquidity is not tight like right now, I don’t see how QE is helpful. So when the banks sell their treasuries to the Fed, they get reserves for it. But if these banks were selling these bonds on the open market they would have got money for it too. The same thing is happening now. If these banks wanted to increase their reserves they just sell their treasuries. So what difference does it make if the Fed is buying these bonds or if some pension fund is buying them. The result is the same. Like I said earlier, I understand there is a difference when markets are tight and the Fed is the only buyer. But when the market is functioning fine, I don’t see what difference QE made. The banks will create reserves wether it came from me or you buying these bonds to the Fed.

t3_gjdgph,"Question about oil ETFs, specifically USO"," I have been looking at the history of oil ETFs specifically USO and how their price correlates to the rise/fall of oil prices. The history of USO seems to be that it tanks when oil tanks, trades sideways when oil prices go sideways, and trades sideways when oil prices surge. Just look at the 2008-2015 oil market bull run and the USO stock price during that period. USO traded sideways. And when oil prices tanked last month, USO dropped so hard they had to do a reverse split. With this in mind are OIL ETFs literally designed to lose money over time, at least in the long term? I cannot imagine a single scenario in which oil prices rise/fall and USO increases in stock prices due to this history.

t3_gj122z,The Phases of the Classic Deflationary Debt Cycle,"I've started to read The Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises by Ray Dalio (You can download here: https://www.bridgewater.com/big-debt-crises/Principles-For-Navigating-Big-Debt-Crises-By-Ray-Dalio.pdf) and I found the part about the phases of the classic deflationary debt cycle a very good read for the present times (Pages 16-38 on the book).

Here are my notes on the section:

As of today, we have already gone through the early part of the cycle (2009-2020), the bubble (we skipped this part in my opinion), and the top (Jan-March 2020). We are currently on the depression portion of the cycle (Which started in mid-march for the US)

The Top did not occur due to typical market forces (interest rates rising), it occurred due to an external force (COVID-19) completely stopping spending on it's tracks (This has never happened before).

The cut in interest rates to 0 on March 15 did little to 1. Produce a positive wealth effect, 2. Stimulate economic activity and 3. Ease debt-service burdens.

The onset of the depression immediately revealed cash-flow problems, which the fed eased by announcing infinite QE and the US govt eased with their first two stimulus bills. Both measures where announced and implemented throughout the last three weeks of March (fiscal policy at a slower pace than monetary policy)

According to Dalio, the policies that reduce debt burdens are the following:

1. Austerity - Although this policy was not enacted, it's happening naturally. With 3 Billion people locked at home at it's peak, we are forced to not spend as much as before. 

2. Debt defaults/restructuring - Also happening, at a slower pace than I expected. 

3. Debt Monetization / Printing - Quickly enacted through QE

4. Wealth Transfers - Not happening yet, although important voices are already signalling that it better be coming (Larry Fink)

The most ideal way out of a deflationary depression is to a 'Beautiful Deleveraging' - aka when the 4 policies above move in a harmonious way where growth grows at a faster pace than debt without inflation spiraling out of control. 

We are not even close to a beautiful deleveraging since income is decreasing at the moment while debt is increasing. 

Important point from page 32: ""People ask if printing money will raise inflation. It won't if it offsets falling credit and the deflationary forces are balanced with this inflationary force.""

According to Dalio's table about well managed beautiful deleveraging on page 35, Both The Federal Reserve and the US Government have done a great job by acting quickly. However that doesn't change the fact that spending is not being stimulated, again because of an external force. 

At this point in time (And it's worth noting, Powell mentioned a variation of this today in his 9:00am video interview), The Federal Reserve is basically out of tools to get businesses and consumers to spend again. It is pretty much out of his scope. 

Monetary Policies Enacted:

MP1 - Interest Rate driven: Enacted on March 4 and March 15

MP2 - QE: Enacted from March 8 to March 23

MP3 - Putting money directly in the hands of spenders: Ongoing, but again, hard to incentivize people to spend. 

Conclusion:

I do believe we are in the depression face of a deflationary debt cycle. The Federal Reserve has done a great job through Monetary Policy so far, and the US Government has done a good job through Fiscal Policy so far. However both are running out of tools in order to solve the last piece of the puzzle: Get business and consumer to SPEND. That lands entirely on the US Government's Public Health Policy.",investing,phase classic deflationary debt cycle,started read principle navigating big debt crisis ray dalio download found part phase classic deflationary debt cycle good read present time page book note section today already gone early part cycle bubble skipped part opinion top jan march currently depression portion cycle started mid march top occur due typical market force interest rate rising occurred due external force covid completely stopping spending track never happened cut interest rate march little produce positive wealth effect stimulate economic activity ease debt service burden onset depression immediately revealed cash flow problem fed eased announcing infinite govt eased first two stimulus bill measure announced implemented throughout last three week march fiscal policy slower pace monetary policy according dalio policy reduce debt burden following austerity although policy enacted happening naturally billion people locked home peak forced spend much debt default restructuring also happening slower pace expected debt monetization printing quickly enacted wealth transfer happening yet although important voice already signalling better coming larry fink ideal way deflationary depression beautiful deleveraging aka policy move harmonious way growth grows faster pace debt without inflation spiraling control even close beautiful deleveraging since income decreasing moment debt increasing important point page people ask printing money raise inflation offset falling credit deflationary force balanced inflationary force according dalio table well managed beautiful deleveraging page federal reserve government done great job acting quickly however change fact spending stimulated external force point time worth noting powell mentioned variation today video interview federal reserve basically tool get business consumer spend pretty much scope monetary policy enacted interest rate driven enacted march march enacted march march putting money directly hand spender ongoing hard incentivize people spend conclusion believe depression face deflationary debt cycle federal reserve done great job monetary policy far government done good job fiscal policy far however running tool order solve last piece puzzle get business consumer spend land entirely government public health policy,phase classic deflationary debt cycle started read principle navigating big debt crisis ray dalio download found part phase classic deflationary debt cycle good read present time page book note section today already gone early part cycle bubble skipped part opinion top jan march currently depression portion cycle started mid march top occur due typical market force interest rate rising occurred due external force covid completely stopping spending track never happened cut interest rate march little produce positive wealth effect stimulate economic activity ease debt service burden onset depression immediately revealed cash flow problem fed eased announcing infinite govt eased first two stimulus bill measure announced implemented throughout last three week march fiscal policy slower pace monetary policy according dalio policy reduce debt burden following austerity although policy enacted happening naturally billion people locked home peak forced spend much debt default restructuring also happening slower pace expected debt monetization printing quickly enacted wealth transfer happening yet although important voice already signalling better coming larry fink ideal way deflationary depression beautiful deleveraging aka policy move harmonious way growth grows faster pace debt without inflation spiraling control even close beautiful deleveraging since income decreasing moment debt increasing important point page people ask printing money raise inflation offset falling credit deflationary force balanced inflationary force according dalio table well managed beautiful deleveraging page federal reserve government done great job acting quickly however change fact spending stimulated external force point time worth noting powell mentioned variation today video interview federal reserve basically tool get business consumer spend pretty much scope monetary policy enacted interest rate driven enacted march march enacted march march putting money directly hand spender ongoing hard incentivize people spend conclusion believe depression face deflationary debt cycle federal reserve done great job monetary policy far government done good job fiscal policy far however running tool order solve last piece puzzle get business consumer spend land entirely government public health policy

t3_giy6p7,Is (Systematic) Value Investing Dead? (A bit wonkish) - Cliff Asness,"https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Perspectives/Is-Systematic-Value-Investing-Dead

&gt;Let’s start with the very basics. Below is a chart of the value spread (the ratio of how “expensive” expensive stocks are vs. cheap stocks – a chart we sometimes call “the value of value”).10
   See here or here if you need a refresher. These value spread analyses require decisions both on which value factor is used and how its attractiveness is measured. The simplest choice, and the one that aligns best with the academic and practitioner literature, is to use price-to-book sorting (the HML factor) and to evaluate it with a matching value spread based on price-to-book. This is indeed what I show in many of the charts below, but the tables will also report value spreads using multiple value measures for these price-to-book sorted portfolios. The idea is to stay reasonably consistent with the literature but also to check that price-to-book is not driving the bus (the major exception for using price-to-book sorting is one later chart where I study a price-to-sales sorted portfolio as a robustness check11
  ). In Figure 1, following Fama and French, I use the whole U.S. stock universe and do not exclude industries nor neutralize industry exposures.12
  


/

&gt;So the expensive stocks are sometimes only &lt;4x as expensive as the cheap stocks, the median is that they are 5.4x more expensive, but today they are almost 12x more expensive. For those first-time listeners, 12x is a lot! Here are some stats we’ll use repeatedly. It is now (March 31, 2020) at the 100th percentile vs. the 50+ years of history we have.13
   Another stat I like to examine is the amount the current reading is over median, divided by the maximum ever reading over median. This complements the percentile as it includes magnitude. Sometimes the 97th percentile is pretty close to the maximum ever, sometimes it’s further away. Here, again obviously, this measure is now at 100% (when you’re at the 100th percentile there is no difference in these measures). Finally, while it’s a somewhat flawed statistic for an autocorrelated and somewhat skewed series, I’ll report the standard deviation event (STD) of the final reading largely to compare across our various tests. Here it’s +4.5. 

/

&gt;C. Excluding Certain Stocks Doesn’t Change the Story

&gt;Using measures other than price-to-book should help a lot if price-to-book is flawed. But we can do better. Now we are going to systematically throw out stocks based on a variety of criteria. For instance, today we would like to examine the value spread versus history if you didn’t include the likes of, say, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, or Tesla (MAGFANT). But we can’t throw just those, and only those, out today as it’s arbitrary and causes an apples-to-oranges problem when comparing to the past. We need to find systematic ways of tossing stocks we worry might be hard to value today that we can apply consistently over the whole 50+ years. I try three (and mention some others in the footnotes).

/

&gt;I show what my colleagues show but in a different, more brute-force but perhaps even clearer way, and come to the same strong conclusion. Value is super cheap today and this is not coming from only the potentially “broken” price-to-book measure (it isn’t even very dependent on it) nor is it due to a group of winner-take-all monopolistic companies. It is not coming exclusively from the tech industries, it is not coming from mega-caps, and it is not coming from the most expensive stocks. Rather it is a pervasive phenomenon.43
   Investors are simply paying way more than usual for the stocks they love versus the ones they hate (and measured using our most realistic implementation this is the clear maximum they’ve ever paid) and doing it in a highly diversified way up and down the cross-section of stocks.

If you are familiar with how N95 masks are made the key component that is in shortage worldwide and limits the quantity that can be made is a nonwoven fabric that is melt  blown by a specialized machine. From the beginning of this crisis, industrialized countries have been scouring the globe for these machines as they are the key to being able to produce N95 masks. Here is a CBS [article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/n95-mask-shortage-melt-blown-filters/) on this.

Enter [Lydall](https://lydall.com/) (LDL), a small-cap, US company that has been making filters right here in the US for decades and has domestic lines with these machines. That Trump visit of a Honeywell factory that makes mask last week? The filters are made by Lydall for Honeywell.

A big portion of Lydall's business is car and building ventilation filters, and they reacted quickly early in the crisis to shut down the car filters lines and ramped up new lines for PPE. PPE made in the US will be here to stay and soon filtration demand for buildings will soar. Look at their portfolio: almost everything they make is in high demand right now.

The Nikkei 225 has returned a total of -50% (yes, negative) over the past 30 years though deflation and stronger yen relative to other currencies may have blunted some of that impact.  Only from 2011-2019 did the Nikkei return a respectable 7-7.5% pa.  

At what point would you pull your money from the market and put it into cash or bonds?  One strategy is to ensure geographical diversification and invest in other developed and emerging markets - but many of them are tied to the US so it may not provide much of a hedge.

t3_gjejas,Why TLRD:US market participants have likely misjudged,"Tailored Brands (Ticker code TLRD:US) has gone down by 95% or so already, to $0.98 USD. Yet sellers may have made mistakes in valuing this business. 

Tailored brands is currently the largest provider of formalwear in the USA, and it owns Men's Wearhouse, JoS. A. Bank Clothiers and Moores.

Perhaps due to the some mental shortcuts, like:

Social proof:
They see what the crowd is doing (selling) and they feel comfort in doing the same thing, even if they are wrong.

Scarcity:
People see a recession coming and they want money in their own hands. This drives down the price further.

Authority:
People tell them that brick and mortar stores are going out of business due to internet retailing. Not really applicable in this case, because suits need to be measured.

Reciprocation:
The stock has lost a great deal of money for them, so they want to pay it back by driving the price even lower.

Also, losses are more painful than gains so they probably want to be rid of it just so they don’t see it anymore.

Or other factors such as:
Not recognising the assets TLRD:US owns, since it was renamed from Mens Wearhouse circa 2015.

Leverage:
If they are leveraged, they may be forced to sell the stock regardless of their desire to keep it. This doesn’t apply to us!

Also there are psychological motivators such as:
Incentives (extreme fear, wanting to make their money fast - so looking for the hot new opportunity)

Denial (they see what they could have spent the money on otherwise)

Pavlovian association (feeling like they are being punished for holding the stock, association of suits with funeral wear due to constant pandemic coverage and so on)

Stress induced misjudgments (perhaps due to leverage)

Extra vivid evidence (recent bankruptcies of the clothing retailers Nordstrom and J Crew).

Analysing the raw numbers shows it is unlikely that TLRD:US will go out of business, as they have had between $11m and $240m of positive free cash flow annually in the last 5 years. The company is also the largest retailer of formalwear in the USA and therefore likely has many economies of scale.

Human misjudgments have therefore likely made this the deal of the year, due to the lollapalooza effect of multiple mental shortcuts and multiple misjudgment factors.

When we purchase, we can probably expect the price to drop further.

My prediction is that once the big dividends kick back in, the reciprocation tendencies to drive down the price further will fade. Once the price stabilises, a new type of social proof can arise and the stress induced misjudgements can decrease. These are causes which would work to show the real value of the business and therefore drive the price up, perhaps significantly. Once the pandemic coverage ceases, positive pavlovian associations can kick in.

At the current time we can get more value than we have paid for. TLRD:US is now selling for less than $50m USD (private market sale price) yet has nearly 1700 stores, 17000 employees, $3.3B in sales and between $11m-$240m in Free Cash Flow annually. That is like buying a grocery store for about one to five years of net profit.

Additionally it is the largest formalwear provider in the USA, with corresponding efficiencies of scale that are unavailable to most competitors.

Also, TLRD:US debt is funded by 4.5% bonds. If inflation rises to its historical average of between 2% and 4%, the debt burden of TLRD:US will be far lighter than it is at present.

A strong inflationary force at this time is the Fed printing trillions of dollars, because it makes each USD purchase less than it did previously. If inflation goes above 4.5%, the $2.2B worth of bonds will actually become assets on the balance sheet of TLRD:US and they will be a corresponding liability for the fixed debt bondholders.

t3_gjde4n,Would Net Earnings generally translate into increases in Net Equity?," 

If a company has $10m in earnings (revenue-expenses) per year, and $100 in assets-liabilities=equity, if we assume that nothing really changes would those earnings more or less translate into increases in assets (or decreases in liabilities such as paying down debt)?

Essentially I'm asking if Equity is the Integral of Earnings on average. To reverse that earnings would be the derivative (change) in equity. If this is not the case what might be some situations that would cause it to be different?

Is this the right place to ask this? I'm trying to understand finance from a fundamentals perspective and I want to know how much calculus applied to accounting could be used to evaluate companies.

I'm thinking that the equation that Value = Equity + Earnings\*Coefficient should be a decent way to do it under the assumption that X years of earnings is ""baked"" into the value of the company under the assumption that earnings will translate into equity and I want to know how accurate my intuition is in this situation.",investing,would net earnings generally translate increase net equity,company earnings revenue expense per year asset liability equity assume nothing really change would earnings translate increase asset decrease liability paying debt essentially asking equity integral earnings average reverse earnings would derivative change equity case might situation would cause different right place ask trying understand finance fundamental perspective want know much calculus applied accounting could used evaluate company thinking equation value equity earnings coefficient decent way assumption year earnings baked value company assumption earnings translate equity want know accurate intuition situation,would net earnings generally translate increase net equity company earnings revenue expense per year asset liability equity assume nothing really change would earnings translate increase asset decrease liability paying debt essentially asking equity integral earnings average reverse earnings would derivative change equity case might situation would cause different right place ask trying understand finance fundamental perspective want know much calculus applied accounting could used evaluate company thinking equation value equity earnings coefficient decent way assumption year earnings baked value company assumption earnings translate equity want know accurate intuition situation
t3_giqu5l,Druckenmiller Says Risk-Reward in Stocks Is Worst He’s Seen,"Stan Druckenmiller said the risk-reward calculation for equities is the worst he’s seen in his career, and that the government stimulus programs won’t be enough to overcome real world economic problems.

“The consensus out there seems to be: ‘Don’t worry, the Fed has your back,’” said Druckenmiller on Tuesday during a webcast held by The Economic Club of New York. “There’s only one problem with that: our analysis says it’s not true.”

While traders think there is “massive” liquidity and that the stimulus programs are big enough to solve the problems facing the U.S., the economic effects of the coronavirus are likely to be long lasting and will lead to a slew of bankruptcies, he said.

“I pray I’m wrong on this, but I just think that the V-out is a fantasy,” the legendary hedge fund manager said, referring to a V-shaped recovery.

Druckenmiller’s remarks are among the strongest comments yet by a Wall Street heavyweight on the bleak outlook facing the U.S. They also stand in contrast to the optimism that has pushed the S&amp;P 500 Index to rally almost 30% since its March low even as the pandemic has brought the economy to a standstill, seized up credit markets and ended the longest bull market in history.

The damage spurred the Federal Reserve to unveil a raft of emergency lending programs and Congress to unleash almost $3 trillion in stimulus funds. But those programs aren’t likely to spur future economic growth, Druckenmiller said.

“It was basically a combination of transfer payments to individuals, basically paying them more not to work than to work,” he said. “And in addition to that, it was a bunch of payments to zombie companies to keep them alive.”

Druckenmiller said he thinks that the current liquidity will soon shrink as U.S. Treasury borrowing crowds out the private economy and even overwhelms Fed purchases.

Druckenmiller, 66, the former chief strategist for George Soros, converted his hedge fund into Duquesne Family Office in 2010. His long-term track record, making returns of about 30% a year over three decades, established him as one of the world’s top money mangers. He has an estimated net worth of $5.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Like other investors and Wall Street executives, Druckenmiller agrees that the pandemic will lead to more regulation and higher taxes.

Other highlights from the Druckenmiller interview:

In the future, he said he wouldn’t be surprised if the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak becomes the “poster child for the worst public policy decisions ever made from a cost-benefit analysis.”
On a relative basis, he’s as bullish on long-short strategies as he’s been in 10 years. “That’s partly because I’m worried about everything else,” he said.
Druckenmiller was also bullish on Amazon.com Inc., saying people should be thankful that the company exists right now given the number of jobs created. He also praised its transition to less profitable, essential-needs products without raising prices.

t3_gj9a2p,Allogene (ALLO) hit &gt;40% returns after-hours on positive safety and efficacy data!,"Two days ago we posted a write-up on the good likelihood that Allogene (ALLO) would demonstrate positive safety and efficacy data from their P1 trial in their ASCO abstract. **Today, positive results led to a &gt;40% return after-hours. We made adjustments to our position on this news.** Here's a quick download of what was found in the paper:

**TL;DR:** The relatively clean safety sheet overall coupled with our expectation that the higher dose groups will be enriched for the complete responders once we get a deeper look on 5/29 has us confident that Allogene is triangulating on a relatively safe, highly efficacious dose to take forward into further development.

\---

The ASCO abstracts including  Allogene's ALPHA trial abstract have been released. All in all the abstract supports our thesis for Allogene that we walked through in our recent write up, though we will need to wait for the 5/29 presentation for a more detailed look at the data. Key takeaways from the abstract include: 

1) No dose-limiting toxicities or GvHD observed: this is great news 

2) Only 2 (22.2%) of patients developed Grade 1 - 2 CRS, which resolved within 72 hours 

3) 78% ORR, including 3 complete responses. Given this was a dose-ranging study, what we will be looking for in the 5/29 readout is how the higher dose groups in particular responded, since these will likely be the doses taken into the pivotal trial.",investing,allogene allo hit return hour positive safety efficacy data,two day ago posted write good likelihood allogene allo would demonstrate positive safety efficacy data trial asco abstract today positive result led return hour made adjustment position news quick download found paper relatively clean safety sheet overall coupled expectation higher dose group enriched complete responder get deeper look confident allogene triangulating relatively safe highly efficacious dose take forward development asco abstract including allogene alpha trial abstract released abstract support thesis allogene walked recent write though need wait presentation detailed look data key takeaway abstract include dose limiting toxicity gvhd observed great news patient developed grade resolved within hour orr including complete response given dose ranging study looking readout higher dose group particular responded since likely dos taken pivotal trial,allogene allo hit return hour positive safety efficacy data two day ago posted write good likelihood allogene allo would demonstrate positive safety efficacy data trial asco abstract today positive result led return hour made adjustment position news quick download found paper relatively clean safety sheet overall coupled expectation higher dose group enriched complete responder get deeper look confident allogene triangulating relatively safe highly efficacious dose take forward development asco abstract including allogene alpha trial abstract released abstract support thesis allogene walked recent write though need wait presentation detailed look data key takeaway abstract include dose limiting toxicity gvhd observed great news patient developed grade resolved within hour orr including complete response given dose ranging study looking readout higher dose group particular responded since likely dos taken pivotal trial

t3_gj2h4e,Alternative Protein Stocks," Tyson has created a suspiciously McDonald’s like vegetarian chicken nuggets under the brand name Raised and Rooted. If you think McDonald's is going to make a deal with Beyond over Tyson, take a look at who McDonald’s is currently sourcing from.

[https://www.raisedandrooted.com/products/plant-based-nuggets/](https://www.raisedandrooted.com/products/plant-based-nuggets/)

Tyson does &gt;$40 Billion in sales per year. More and more Americans, especially the younger generations, are looking for alternatives. Tyson knows this has already taken steps to innovate and is heavily investing in various meat alternatives. In fact, Tyson had an investment in Beyond before pulling out to make their own baby.

\~70% of Beyond fast-food sales are currently coming from customers who are not vegan / vegetarian but want more vegetables and cleaner protein in their diet. While Tyson has the capital and cash to go to war with, and eventually crush Beyond, Tyson is leaving the vegan patty maker alone. Tyson is instead poised to take on the vegetarian and hybrid meat alternative sectors.

Because robots are immune to coronavirus, Tyson is also taking steps into the future by investing in automated meat packing lines. This will cause the price of food to increase in the short term. Well, maybe long term if the money printer doesn’t take a break. In the short term, they are adapting to ‘the new normal’ by implementing Chinese manufacturing level safety measures and adding some temp scanning tech to the mix.

But part of the clean protein source in the nuggets comes from chickens. What happens to the actual chickens hatching those eggs? Europe has high standards for chickens and won’t buy from Tyson. The US is taxing (tariff) Chinese imports. China has a protein food shortage and could not care less about animal rights and is subsidizing chicken imports. So, Tyson is freezing chickens and shipping them to China.

t3_gj23pe,"$NMHLY, does this mean it will soon file for bankruptcy, or it's just selling parts of the business to pay off debt with the intention/goal to resume business?","(Bloomberg) -- NMC Health Plc’s administrators have started selling off assets of the troubled Middle Eastern hospital operator as they seek funds to pay back creditors, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Officials overseeing the process at restructuring specialist Alvarez &amp; Marsal Inc. have invited bids for NMC’s distribution business, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Potential acquirers have been asked to submit offers this month, the people said.
Administrators are planning to start a sale process for Abu Dhabi-based NMC’s lucrative fertility business as soon as June or July, the people said. They are considering eventually selling most of the company’s assets, potentially including the flagship hospital business, which is the biggest private health-care provider in the Middle East, the people said.
The moves mark the official beginning of the dismantling of NMC, once a member of London’s elite FTSE 100 index with a market value as high as $11 billion. NMC started unraveling in recent months after unearthing previously undisclosed debt and evidence of fraud, leading to the dismissal of top executives. Its downfall has roped in lenders including Barclays Plc, Standard Chartered Plc and the biggest banks in the United Arab Emirates.
Quick Process
The administrators are moving fast, asking suitors to size up the distribution business and submit proposals in a matter of days, the people said. No final decisions have been made, and there’s no certainty the discussions will lead to a transaction, they said.
A representative for NMC said the company is in the process of exploring “various options” for its distribution business, NMC Trading, “which it has determined to be non-core.”
“The management team’s priority is to stabilize the business and ensure continuity of care at its hospitals and medical centers,” the representative said in a statement. “The group’s distribution business is separate from its main hospital and medical centers business in the UAE.”
The U.K.’s Financial Reporting Council last week said it opened an investigation into Ernst &amp; Young LLP’s auditing of NMC’s 2018 financial statements. The probe started April 15 and could result in sanctions such as fines.
Medical Equipment
NMC Trading distributes products including Nestle SA food and beverages, Pfizer Inc. medicine and Unilever Plc personal-care products across the U.A.E. It also markets foreign brands of medical equipment, educational materials, office supplies and veterinary products in the country.
The business employs more than 1,700 people and distributes products to more than 10,000 points of sale including hypermarkets, gas stations and hospitals, according to information displayed on its website in March.

t3_giztvq,Market Tumbles Earlier After Powell Warns Of 'Lasting Damage' Due To Coronavirus,"Stocks cut gains from the pre-market  session and opened lower Wednesday, as traders eyed commentary from  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

In his comments, Powell undercut hopes of a quick V-shaped recovery for the U.S. economy amid the coronavirus pandemic, [saying that a deep, long downturn could](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/federal-reserve-chairman-powell-us-economy-faces-longer-term-concerns-130001781.html) “leave behind lasting damage” to economic productivity.

“The  recovery may take some time to gather momentum, and the passage of time  can turn liquidity problems into solvency problems,” Powell said during  his webcast appearance with the Peterson Institute for International  Economics, according to prepared remarks.

Powell  also reiterated that the central bank would use all of its monetary  policy tools “until the crisis has passed and the economic recovery is  well under way,” and suggested that Congress boost fiscal stimulus to  mitigate the risk of longer-term economic damage.

The  remarks reiterated sentiments previously expressed by other Fed  officials, many of whom acknowledged that the extended shutdowns that  have helped bring down new case growth for the virus have simultaneously  come at the expense of economic and business activity. A number of  Federal Reserve officials who delivered public remarks on issued more  cautious commentary around the coronavirus’s near- and long-term impacts  on the U.S. economy and financial markets.

Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, a voter in this year’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), [said Tuesday](https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20200512-an-update-on-the-economy-and-the-federal-reserves-policy-response.aspx)  she expected unemployment to hit or top 20% domestically, and for  second-quarter annualized GDP growth to be negative by as much as 40%,  before a gradual economic recovery kicks off in the second half of the  year.

And during a webcast Tuesday, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard [said widespread shelter](https://www.omfif.org/events/the-federal-reserves-outlook-for-testing-times/)  in place orders could not go on indefinitely, saying, “You’ll get too  many business failures and you’ll really do lasting damage.”

I’ve been trying to review past market cycles in hopes to better understand what to expect in the coming months by reading Jeremy Siegel’s stocks for the long run

[stocks for the long run ](https://www.riosmauricio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Siegel_Stocks-For-The-Long-Run.pdf)

Having trouble posting a picture of the table but for reference it’s on pg 173

Here are some statistics from the past 10 market cycles starting in 1948

- From “peak of stock index” to the “peak of the business cycle” on average is usually 5.7 months with a range of 0-13 months 

- Between the “peak of stock index” and “peak of the business cycle” there is on average an 8.21% drop with a range of 0%-22.94% 

- Average decline in the 12 following months 17.47% with a range of 8.65%-38.80% 

I understand these are unusual times that may change our market cycle because of the following reasons. 

- Unlimited QE
- Coronavirus 
- Stay at home orders

Along with a few of factors but you get the point

Facts

- Spy peaked at 339.08 on 19 Feb 2020 (3 months ago)
- Spy is down 15.45% from its all time high 
- There’s an insane amount of factors that point towards a stock market decline 

As I said earlier I understand that times are different but history is pointing towards a bear market in the coming months ( my guess is mid June). What I’m looking to start a conversation about is, can this be kept up forever? For the people who are bullish over the next 12 month period why? And the people who are bearish what are your thoughts on this information? Is it a good reference? Are you using any other metrics to help with your predictions?

t3_gikdhe,George Soros Bets big on DraftKings," 

(Bloomberg) -- George Soros has a $66 million stake in DraftKings Inc., one of several big-name investors to receive shares in the sports-betting company through a deal that took it public last month.

Quantum Partners, an investment vehicle run by Soros Fund Management, holds 2.7 million DraftKings Class A shares, according to a filing last week with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A spokesman declined to comment on behalf of Soros Fund Management, which oversees investments on behalf of the 89-year-old philanthropist and his family.

DraftKings has expanded its investor base beyond the sports world as it competes in the growing market for legal online wagering. The company, which began in 2012 as a fantasy-sports platform, drew startup investments from Major League Baseball as well as Jerry Jones and Robert Kraft, owners of the National Football League’s Dallas Cowboys and New England Patriots, respectively, prior to the reverse merger last month with blank-check company Diamond Eagle Acquisition Corp.

Soros Fund Management, which oversees roughly $25 billion, has been investing more conservatively under Dawn Fitzpatrick, its chief investment officer since 2017. But the firm made at least one other opportunistic investment amid the coronavirus pandemic, disclosing last quarter that it held 2.7 million shares of Peloton Interactive Inc., the supplier of upscale stationary bikes and related online workout programs. The stock has since soared 58%, lifting the value of the stake to $117 million.

DraftKings is up 40% since the Boston-based company went public through a reverse merger on April 23. Mousse Partners, the family office that invests the Chanel fortune for the Wertheimers, holds $88 million in shares, the filing shows. Michael Gordon, a former money manager with Jeffrey Vinik’s hedge fund, has a stake of almost $20 million.

Kraft’s DraftKings holding is larger than that of his NFL rival, according to the filing. Kraft and his sons Jonathan and Daniel own 3.53 million shares while Legends Hospitality, an investment vehicle set up by the Cowboys and the New York Yankees, has 194,867.

Several owners of pro-basketball teams are also listed as investors in DraftKings for the first time.

Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp., controlled by the Dolan family that owns the New York Knicks, indirectly has almost 1.5 million shares. Stephen Pagliuca, co-chairman of Bain Capital and a co-owner of the Boston Celtics, has about 566,000 shares through a partnership with Anastasios Parafestas, the head of Bollard Group.

Representatives for the investors either declined to comment or didn’t return telephone calls.

t3_ghxwi6,Goldman Says Stocks Due for 18% Drop After Rally Driven by FOMO,"In the equity market, fear of missing out seems to be overshadowing fear of all that’s wrong with the economy. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. says pessimism will soon get the upper hand and send the S&amp;P 500 Index down almost 20% in the next three months.

Fiscal and monetary support over the past few weeks of the coronavirus pandemic successfully warded off a financial crisis, but a return to economic normalcy is still a long ways away and investors have gotten ahead of themselves, the bank’s chief U.S. equity strategist, David Kostin, wrote in a report.

Financial, economic and political risks darken the outlook for domestic equities, Goldman warns. The bank cites the lack of flattening in the U.S. infection curve outside of New York, what promises to be a lengthy re-start process, a 50% hit to buybacks in 2020 and the risk of higher corporate taxes and de facto consumption taxes if U.S.-China trade tensions bubble up again.

“A single catalyst may not spark a pullback, but a number of concerns and risks exist that we believe, and our client discussions confirm, investors are downplaying,” Kostin wrote. Goldman says the S&amp;P 500 will probably drop to 2,400 over the next three months before it rebounds to 3,000 by year end.

The index slumped 0.5% Monday to 2,914 as of 9:45 a.m. in New York.


Kostin notes that large swaths of the investor community have failed to cash in on the S&amp;P 500’s 31% surge since its trough on March 23. He points out that most mutual funds have underperformed since the bear market low, with long/short and macro hedge funds posting single-digit returns as a group, and investors may face pressure to chase the rally.

“The ‘fear of missing out’ best describes the thought process,” Kostin said.

Futures positioning shows investors still doubt S&amp;P 500 rebound

But he warns that it’s a risky move. Even with measures of the breadth of the recent rally improving in recent days -- potentially signaling more buy-in on the idea the gains will last -- Goldman Sachs’ sentiment indicator has barely improved since mid-March.

“Skepticism abounds regarding the likelihood the rally will continue,” the strategist writes.

relates to Goldman Says Stocks Due for 18% Drop After Rally Driven by FOMO
Kostin is pessimistic on the outlook for corporate profits, citing frozen growth plans and capital expenditures will drop 27% this year. He points out that the only encouraging driver for earnings is the swelling federal deficit, which in effect acts as substantial support for demand.

Caution on equities may also be warranted in the face of stretched valuations -- to the extent that anything about 2021’s bottom-line outlook can be discerned.

The benchmark U.S. stock gauge trades at 19.5 times the buy side’s estimate of next year’s earnings, Kostin concludes, the highest level since 2002.

t3_giz7pv,How and why VTIQ will be grow to be a giant competing with Tesla,"**TL:DR $VTIQ is the next big jumper especially after their merger this summer with Nikola Motors. They are led by a genius who has already beat Tesla once in a lawsuit over multiple patents and the numbers seem to point to an upwards trend.**

Okay boys and girls I am back and here to talk about Tesla’s ballbuster, VTIQ, or VectoIQ Acquisition. So you may be asking what this company is and let me give you a quick gist, VectoIQ is a holding company led by former **General Motors** vice chairman Steve Girsky. It has no real business of its own, but it has drawn a *lot* of interest from auto investors lately because of its plan to merge with Nikola Motors. VectoIQ's stock has had an especially strong run in the last few sessions, after the company confirmed in a series of regulatory filings that the merger is on track to close in early June. 

Now lets go over some fundamentals of this company and its soon ally Nikola Motors. First of all this company is led by Steve Girsky. Girsky joined the board of GM in July 2009 as the company emerged from a U.S. and Canadian taxpayer bailout and bankruptcy. He was a key advisor to GM’s chief executives since before the 2009 bankruptcy. Girsky led restructuring efforts at Opel, GM’s primary brand in Europe, and pushed GM executives to embrace investments in digital technology and mobile internet connectivity that the company has now made central to its product strategy. In addition to being a board member, Girsky was GM vice chairman from March 2010 to January 2014, heading up GM’s global strategy during that time. He was the chairman of the Adam Opel AG supervisory board as GM struggled to bring Opel back to profitability at a time when some of his former counterparts on Wall Street thought GM should try to sell the brand. So basically this guy knows how to lead a company and more so assist a company in developing a brand and establishing a foundation even in the most troubled of times.

Now let's get into which companies hold VTIQ and can help in pushing this company higher. We have BlackRock with 2.2 million shares and Karpus with 2.3 million shares along with 37 other investment firms trying to enjoy the ride with VTIQ too, including a retirement fund too. Now the retirement fund is interesting since 95% of the time these funds try to go with safe investments because it is for the long run, so them investing in something like this means they know how little the downside is.

Now Nikola Motors is poised to be going into a brawl with the great all knowing Elon Musk, but thing is they have already won round one. Almost two years ago, Nikola Motors surprised the trucking market by filing a $2 billion lawsuit alleging that the Tesla Semi copied several design elements from the Nikola One, the truck-maker’s flagship hydrogen long hauler. News about the patent lawsuit has been scarce for over a year, but recent updates indicate that Nikola has snatched a small victory from the Silicon Valley-based electric car maker. Nikola’s case listed several characteristics of the One that were allegedly copied by Tesla. These included the Semi’s wraparound windshield, mid-entry door, front fenders, and the all-electric truck’s aerodynamic shape. To highlight its point, Nikola stated that the similar drag coefficient between the One (0.37) and the Semi (0.36) was further proof that the battery electric long hauler was copied from the hydrogen fuel-cell sleeper cab. 

Excerpts from Nikola’s lawsuit pointed out that the Semi’s design had caused confusion among the One’s customers, diverting sales from the hydrogen truck maker to Tesla. Nikola also argued that these confusions might result in the Semi’s problems being attributed to the One, such as those resulting from Tesla’s batteries and Autopilot software.

Well here was the ruling on that: **Tesla loses bid to invalidate Nikola Motor patents in USPTO dispute. USPTO not only upheld Nikola semi truck's important patents but refused Tesla's request to modify our patents. Two billion dollar lawsuit moving forward. We will defend our company's IP no matter who it is.**

And last but not least let's get into the numbers. VTIQ has moved up significantly in the past month and is seeming to not be slowing down in any sense. With the MACD set to a 2.1 and 1.0 difference with the RSI being still lower than their previous March jump, they seem to have a huge jump left to be had. As of recently they had a 13 million volume which is still 5 million less than their highest volume level of 18 million so it seems like there is a lot of money left to be made.

t3_gibgri,Core consumer prices saw the largest monthly drop ever in April,"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/12/core-consumer-prices-saw-the-largest-monthly-drop-ever-in-april.html

&gt;Consumer prices in April took their biggest drop in history going back to at least 1957 as the economy reeled from restrictions imposed to control the coronavirus.

&gt;The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday that the CPI excluding food and energy prices slumped 0.4%, the steepest monthly drop since records have been kept.

&gt;While the decline in prices was broad-based, the biggest swoons in the “core” part of the index came in apparel and transportation services, which dropped 4.7% apiece. Commodities not including food and energy fell 0.7% and medical care services prices were off 0.5%. Used cars saw a 0.4% decline amid a slide in auto sales.

&gt;Big drops within the categories were car and truck rentals (-16.6%), airline fares (-15.2%) and men’s suits (-11.3%).

&gt;On a year-over-year basis, core CPI rose 1.4%, the smallest move since April 2011.

&gt;The moves come amid a series of fiscal and monetary moves aimed at juicing economic activity. Rescue efforts from both sides have been unprecedented in dollar amount and breadth, but come amid an economy frozen in place that will see a drop in GDP for the second quarter that will be unparalleled. 

&gt;The Federal Reserve continues to pump money into the economy amid a deflationary threat and an unemployment situation at its worst point since the Great Depression.

&gt;“The Federal Reserve should be more worried about deflation, when prices are falling broadly in the economy, rather than inflation, when prices are rising. If deflation becomes embedded in the economy, it can be difficult to uproot,” said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC. “If prices are falling, consumers and businesses may wait to make purchases, assuming that prices will be even lower in the future; this can exacerbate economic downturns.”

&gt;Headline CPI, which included huge drops in energy but big jumps in food costs, fell 0.8% and was up just 0.3% from a year ago. The index for cereals and bakery products, for instance, rose 2.9% in April for its largest monthly increase ever.
Food at home prices increased 2.6% as part of a broader 1.5% move higher in the overall category. A number of categories saw major spikes as Americans came under stay-at-home orders. 
Energy prices were off 10.1% for the month, due in part to a 20.6% plunge in gasoline.",investing,core consumer price saw largest monthly drop ever april,consumer price april took biggest drop history going back least economy reeled restriction imposed control coronavirus bureau labor statistic reported tuesday cpi excluding food energy price slumped steepest monthly drop since record kept decline price broad based biggest swoon core part index came apparel transportation service dropped apiece commodity including food energy fell medical care service price used car saw decline amid slide auto sale big drop within category car truck rental airline fare men suit year year basis core cpi rose smallest move since april move come amid series fiscal monetary move aimed juicing economic activity rescue effort side unprecedented dollar amount breadth come amid economy frozen place see drop gdp second quarter unparalleled federal reserve continues pump money economy amid deflationary threat unemployment situation worst point since great depression federal reserve worried deflation price falling broadly economy rather inflation price rising deflation becomes embedded economy difficult uproot said faucher chief economist pnc price falling consumer business may wait make purchase assuming price even lower future exacerbate economic downturn headline cpi included huge drop energy big jump food cost fell year ago index cereal bakery product instance rose april largest monthly increase ever food home price increased part broader move higher overall category number category saw major spike american came stay home order energy price month due part plunge gasoline,core consumer price saw largest monthly drop ever april consumer price april took biggest drop history going back least economy reeled restriction imposed control coronavirus bureau labor statistic reported tuesday cpi excluding food energy price slumped steepest monthly drop since record kept decline price broad based biggest swoon core part index came apparel transportation service dropped apiece commodity including food energy fell medical care service price used car saw decline amid slide auto sale big drop within category car truck rental airline fare men suit year year basis core cpi rose smallest move since april move come amid series fiscal monetary move aimed juicing economic activity rescue effort side unprecedented dollar amount breadth come amid economy frozen place see drop gdp second quarter unparalleled federal reserve continues pump money economy amid deflationary threat unemployment situation worst point since great depression federal reserve worried deflation price falling broadly economy rather inflation price rising deflation becomes embedded economy difficult uproot said faucher chief economist pnc price falling consumer business may wait make purchase assuming price even lower future exacerbate economic downturn headline cpi included huge drop energy big jump food cost fell year ago index cereal bakery product instance rose april largest monthly increase ever food home price increased part broader move higher overall category number category saw major spike american came stay home order energy price month due part plunge gasoline

Second EDIT: I'm going to be synthesizing an answer for the benefit of everyone and myself. So far we have a bunch of really interesting comments. As for the timing of this phenomenon, lots of commenters have mentioned that an enormous amount of equities are in the hands of large financial institutions and that they operate in a type ""hivemind"" way and definitely do not collude with one another. Following this theory, souring talks between China and the US (Graham Bill), comments by the Fed, and the LA area announcing an extended quarantine may have changed this ""hivemind"" at around 1.5 hours before closing.

t3_giatpb,"Dividend investor or passive ETF investor? What is ""better"" strategy?","**My background and goals:**

I have a steady income which I was aggressively saving and that money were put into ETF index funds (VTI/BND 80:20 ratio) for over 5 years. After that, I have started to put money more into quality dividend paying companies with good fundaments (mostly Dividend Aristocrats/Dividend Champions / Dividend Contenders). This is what I did in the last 2 years.

My current situation is that I have transferred all my portfolio from ETF funds into dividend-paying stocks. I don't need to withdraw anything from my stock portfolio for the next 10 years minimum. I am working and still contributing to my investment account from my salary (not as much as before, but still 30-40% of my net salary).

**My questions:**

1. What are the benefits of dividend investing over passive ETF investing? You have to be extremely skillfull / educated and involved / lucky to actually beat the results of ETF fund like VTI in the long run. (not to mention your time invested).
2. I have played with the numbers and it seems that I cannot beat the performance of VTI (or VTI/BND)  with quality dividend companies. See following example (which is similar to my portfolio):

[https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=2010&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=VTI&amp;allocation1\_1=80&amp;symbol2=BND&amp;allocation2\_1=20&amp;allocation2\_2=20&amp;symbol3=VT&amp;allocation3\_2=80&amp;symbol4=ABBV&amp;allocation4\_3=8&amp;symbol5=BEN&amp;allocation5\_3=14&amp;symbol6=BNS&amp;allocation6\_3=5&amp;symbol7=CCL&amp;allocation7\_3=6&amp;symbol8=ENB&amp;allocation8\_3=6&amp;symbol9=GILD&amp;allocation9\_3=6&amp;symbol10=MO&amp;allocation10\_3=10&amp;symbol11=RDS.B&amp;allocation11\_3=12&amp;symbol12=T&amp;allocation12\_3=7&amp;symbol13=WFC&amp;allocation13\_3=12&amp;symbol14=XOM&amp;allocation14\_3=14](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=2010&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=VTI&amp;allocation1_1=80&amp;symbol2=BND&amp;allocation2_1=20&amp;allocation2_2=20&amp;symbol3=VT&amp;allocation3_2=80&amp;symbol4=ABBV&amp;allocation4_3=8&amp;symbol5=BEN&amp;allocation5_3=14&amp;symbol6=BNS&amp;allocation6_3=5&amp;symbol7=CCL&amp;allocation7_3=6&amp;symbol8=ENB&amp;allocation8_3=6&amp;symbol9=GILD&amp;allocation9_3=6&amp;symbol10=MO&amp;allocation10_3=10&amp;symbol11=RDS.B&amp;allocation11_3=12&amp;symbol12=T&amp;allocation12_3=7&amp;symbol13=WFC&amp;allocation13_3=12&amp;symbol14=XOM&amp;allocation14_3=14)

3) So why should I bother with spending my time researching dividend stocks to produce suboptimal results of my portfolio? An example from portfolio visualiser above clearly shows that VTI (or VTI/BND) clearly outperforms my portfolio consisting of high quality dividend paying stocks.

4) And yet - many people prefer dividend strategy over ETF strategy while still in accumulating phase of their life (that means they don't need those dividends  now) Why is that? Wouldnt they have better results with passive ETF approach? 

5) In my situation, described above, is there any logical reason why I should stick with dividend investing over ETF passive investing strategy? What is the optimal approach?

Thank you for time and space

t3_gii5g8,"If books like Think and Grow Rich and Secrets of the Millionaire mind are bullshit, what should I be reading?","Let me start by saying, I don't think these books, or others like it are ""bullshit"" or have no value. 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe books like these are great for putting you into a money-making mode, they did give me motivation and it's because of these books that I am seeking further knowledge.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 25, I'm Brazilian, am a barber, I don't believe in college/university. I have no money, I have no assets, and my country isn't as awesome as America. I say this to point out the following. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to go to college, or hardcore change my life-style. I like barbering, I like my routine, I feel like it's the first time in my life where I'm being a man about everything that happens to me, and that's making me grow as a person like never before. I'm happy for the first time in my life about who I am, and what I'm doing. I don't want to change something that's been a positive in my life. I've always been on the other side, always negative, always unhappy with my situation in life. So why change what's working.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm healthier mentally than I've ever been, but I read something someone said about these books here on Reddit, and despite not agreeing with him that these are just snake-oil, I do agree that if I did indeed have a millionaire mind, I'd already be growing rich. Men like him don't have to read self-help books, or learn how to get into a money-making mindset. This guy claimed to have taken a loan when he was 21, invested it in a small food cart, and through paying, and investing, and loaning more, he's now living comfortably, making a lot more money than I'd ever dream of.

&amp;#x200B;

What's the difference between a guy like that and me? Lets say everything he said is true. Why can't I take out a loan, and start a lil cheap thing too, and grow it, sell it, loan more money, invest in something bigger, make more, and more and more just like him? I think I have the same capacity to earn in that manner, but I'm not feeling like books like these are what I need.

&amp;#x200B;

What kind of knowledge do I need in order to be able to make these kinds of decisions with confidence? What did I need to know, before I go to the bank and take a 20k loan? What do I need to learn so that I can apply that 20k loan into something that'll make me 25k, or 30k,or 40k back in the shortest amount of time?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't mind working at all, but I don't want to toil away day in, day out in an office, living paycheck to paycheck, waiting a lifetime to get a few crumbs off the pie.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I need to know to make the decisions that people who make money do?

&amp;#x200B;

If Donald Trump swapped bodies with me TODAY, I'm sure he'd be rich again, even without all his contacts, and money. He'd know where to start, and how to make the smart decisions. 

&amp;#x200B;

\--- 

Strong earnings reports, especially from tech companies, drove the markets upwards last week, despite unemployment hitting 14.7%, as the economy shed 20.5M jobs. For context, unemployment reached as high as 25% during the Great Depression. Given the current state of joblessness, why are markets so bullish? Here are the details:

1. **Nearly 30 states have begun to reopen, with another five states with plans to reopen soon.** Investors were bullish about the market as the vast majority of states began to reopen facilities ranging from beaches to retail. As money begins to start flowing through the economy again, investors expect a gradual return to market levels before COVID-19.
2. **The Nasdaq is in positive territory year-to-date as tech stocks have continued to outperform despite COVID-19.** The Nasdaq, an index weighted towards tech, has entered positive territory since the beginning of 2020 due to positive earnings reports from tech companies, including Facebook (FB), Match.com (MTCH), Uber (UBER), and others. Investors expect the index to reach pre-COVID levels soon enough.
3. **The FDA approved the first antigen test for detecting COVID-19****.** The FDA approved Quidel Corp's (QDEL) antigen test for quickly screening for COVID-19. QDEL's antigen test can be completed in minutes compared to traditional PCR tests, which can take hours. This test will help the economy reopen by enabling mass testing at the workplace and beyond. We believe this news will drive the markets upward this coming week.
4. **The April unemployment report indicated 14.7% unemployment, with tech companies like Uber contributing with layoffs.** The federal government released April's unemployment report last Friday and demonstrated a 14.7% unemployment rate. Unemployment mostly stemmed from the hospitality and travel industry. However, tech companies, including Uber (UBER) have recently contributed to layoffs. Uber is cutting 3,700 workers, while Airbnb and Yelp plan on cutting 1,900 and &gt;1,000 employees respectively. While this is devastating for the employees, investors see this decision by tech companies as a cost-cutting measure needed for these companies to achieve greater profitability.
5. **After COVID containment success, South Korea recorded highest daily infections in a month.** South Korea recorded 34 new COVID-19 infections today, the highest one day increase in COVID-19 infections in a month. The U.S. should also expect there to be a second wave of COVID-19 breakouts as the economy opens. However, because countries and people are better prepared for COVID-19, the impact of the second outbreak will not likely result in additional quarantine measures and be dampened in terms of cases and deaths. Furthermore, research is beginning to indicate that even mildly affected COVID-19 cases produce antibodies, suggesting potential for at least partial immunity even from those who had low to no symptoms. 

**Overall, I remain optimistic about the U.S. economic recovery.** While unemployment is incredibly high, government stimulus have enabled most U.S. citizens to sustain in this difficult situation. The reopening of state economies will hopefully provide the stimulus needed for businesses to start re-hiring those who were laid off, leading to a dramatic decrease in unemployment. The May and June jobs reports will be a strong indicator for our recovery.",investing,weekly update expectation,note supposed published sunday accidentally link header enjoy strong earnings report

t3_girez6,What if I sell all my stock? (help me work through the math),"This is hypothetical.  I've been investing for a long time and read a lot, so I know not to time the market and all the other rules of thumb that we follow.  


I'm trying to work out the math if I sold $100k stock right now and what the financial benefit would be in the long run.

**ASSUMPTIONS:**

My profit would be $60k.  Tax rate 22%

Market will drop 25% in the near future.  After that it will rise 4% a year for 5 years.

**SCENARIO 1: Hold the money**

I sell the $100k and pay $13,200 tax, leaving me with $86,800 (profit of $46,800.)  Not bad.  I could put it aside for home improvement.  I am now out of the market.  


**SCENARIO 2: Reinvest if the market drops**   
The market drops 25%.  I re-invest my $86,800.

Market rises 4% a year for 5 years.  I now have $105,600.

&amp;#x200B;

**SCENARIO 3: Do nothing**

I hold my $100k. The market drops 25%.  I now have $75,000.

Market rises 4% a year for 5 years.  I now have $91,248.

&amp;#x200B;

**SUMMARY:**

Is it right that Scenario 2 gives me an advantage of $14,352 ($105,600 - $91.238) over Scenario 3?

It somehow feels like I should be benefitting more than that.  Am I overlooking something?

I know.

It sounds ridiculous. Borderline insane. But why not? I’ve done it before, I can absolutely do it again I feel. If I could compound my account for 8 years at 100% I would be a millionaire. That’s the absolute goal.

t3_gigwt8,All-in VRE and BPY in TFSA," Greetings,

I have recently dumped about $40,000 in a 50/50 ratio of VRE (Vanguard REIT ETF) and BPY (Brookfield Property Partners) in my TFSA. The rationale is that REITs are best held in a tax-sheltered account due to their diverse distributions and troubled accounting during tax season. Also, despite BPY being 1 company, they are globally diversified, which provides me with some level of diversification outside of Canada.

I have a long time horizon (looking to hold for 10+ years or even 20 years), and might draw from the dividends from time to time if needed (hence leaving them in a TFSA). So it's like owning a little real estate empire in my TFSA.

My questions are:

1. What are your thoughts on this method? Yes I know it's extremely undiversified, but I will be diversifying in global stocks in my RRSP, and Canadian dividend stocks in my margin account. My goal here is not diversification, but to concentrate on real estate and maximum yield.
2. I've also been eyeing RIT (CI First Asset REIT ETF), and bought some on my other account. It seems to have historically outperformed all the popular REIT ETFs (ZRE, XRE, VRE), albeit with a rather high management fee. I chose VRE over RIT due to half the MER cost, but it seems like the performance of RIT might be significant enough to justify the MER. Would you pick RIT over VRE? Why or why not?

Thanks and looking forward to a discussion.",investing,vre bpy tfsa,greeting recently dumped ratio vre vanguard reit etf bpy brookfield property partner tfsa rationale reit best held tax sheltered account due diverse distribution troubled accounting tax season also despite bpy company globally diversified provides level diversification outside canada long time horizon looking hold year even year might draw dividend time time needed hence leaving tfsa like owning little real estate empire tfsa question thought method yes know extremely undiversified diversifying global stock rrsp canadian dividend stock margin account goal diversification concentrate real estate maximum yield also eyeing rit first asset reit etf bought account seems historically outperformed popular reit etf zre xre vre albeit rather high management fee chose vre rit due half mer cost seems like performance rit might significant enough justify mer would pick rit vre thanks looking forward discussion,vre bpy tfsa greeting recently dumped ratio vre vanguard reit etf bpy brookfield property partner tfsa rationale reit best held tax sheltered account due diverse distribution troubled accounting tax season also despite bpy company globally diversified provides level diversification outside canada long time horizon looking hold year even year might draw dividend time time needed hence leaving tfsa like owning little real estate empire tfsa question thought method yes know extremely undiversified diversifying global stock rrsp canadian dividend stock margin account goal diversification concentrate real estate maximum yield also eyeing rit first asset reit etf bought account seems historically outperformed popular reit etf zre xre vre albeit rather high management fee chose vre rit due half mer cost seems like performance rit might significant enough justify mer would pick rit vre thanks looking forward discussion

t3_gigeg2,Dividend investing for retirement,"Hey,

New to investing and I'm trying to wrap my head around dividends. I've heard and read that some people have a goal of at retirement having accumulating enough stock to live off of dividends. It could very well be that I don't understand or have done the calculations wrong but it seems like you need to have a prohibitive amount of stock to do this. Very roughly speaking from looking online at a number of high yield dividend stocks it seems they pay out on average $3-$4 yearly per stock. Those stocks sell at around $60-$150. If one wants in retirement to have a yearly salary return of $60,000 that would require having $900,000-$2,000,000 worth of stock. So that sounds insane and unattainable, what am I missing (it could very well be ignorance)

That's been supportive to the market as a whole, since when companies reduce their outstanding share count by repurchasing units, it lifts the per-share value of the remaining stock.

From all the reports I read, and anecdotally - it seems people are not keen on riding in shared vehicles - and would much rather own their rides. A good proof point is that the April SAAR, which is annualized US auto sales of new vehicles was \~8M, 50% down from it's peak - unlike the 80% drop in auto sales as people had expected. This is primarily because of people buying their vehicles and not depending on ride sharing going forward.

Today May 8 SVXY: 35.35, VIXM: 37.64

If you bought $5000 of both on the March 23rd bottom when SVXY: 30.25, VIXM: 39.74, you would have ~165.29 shares of SVXY and ~125.82 shares of VIXM which would be worth $10578.87 today.

I do not know if this strategy will continue working, but so far it's remained slowly but consistently profitable regardless of market conditions.

But yields are still a big driver of expected return, and the expected return for bonds is lower going forward. It's doubtful that bonds will be less volatile, despite the lower expected return. Of course, the bull market might continue and yields hit negative.

People buy bonds to hedge vs. equity. Should allocation to bonds be lower, given the lower expected return of bonds? If you have a targeted return for your portfolio, this seems to make sense. But what else would you buy if equity is still too risky?

Or does it make sense to take on more risk to chase yield, and buy high yield, structured and/or EM bonds? Is the answer simply that the bull market for bonds is over and investors should put up with low returns or seek alternative assets?

Until recently, many policy makers and corporate executives were hoping for a V-shaped economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic: a short, sharp collapse followed by a bounce back to pre-virus levels of activity.

Now, however, they expect a “swoosh” recovery.

Named after the Nike logo, it predicts a large drop followed by a painfully slow recovery, with many Western economies, including the U.S. and Europe, not back to 2019 levels of output until late next year—or beyond.

The sobering new view reflects the depth of the contraction now being recorded for the spring, as well as more evidence that soaring joblessness and months or years of social distancing—particularly in the West—will depress economic activity well into next year.

“This is not going to be a quick recovery,” said Mark Schneider, chief executive of Nestlé SA, the world’s biggest packaged foods maker, recently. “This is going to be a several-quarter, if not several-year kind of process.”

t3_ghpv2t,FDA grants emergency use authorization to Abbott Labs' new coronavirus antibody test,"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/11/coronavirus-fda-grants-emergency-use-authorization-abbott-labs-antibody-test.html

&gt;The Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization for Abbott Laboratories’ new coronavirus test that detects Covid-19 antibodies, the company announced Monday.
Abbott said it plans to ship nearly 30 million tests this month and will have the capacity to ship 60 million tests in June. 
The tests can indicate whether a person has had Covid-19 and was either asymptomatic or recovered.

&gt;“Having more options of highly reliable tests across our platforms will help healthcare workers and health officials as they conduct broad scale testing for Covid-19,” Abbott CEO Robert Ford said in a statement.
The authorization means laboratories will be allowed to use the test even though it has not been formally approved or cleared by the FDA.
U.S. officials and corporations across America are pouring money into antibody testing, hoping it will give people the confidence to return to work and reopen parts of the economy. President Donald Trump has recommended states use the tests as they start relaxing some of the strict social distancing measures imposed to combat the pandemic, which has infected more than 1.3 million people across the United States, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. 

&gt;Last week, the FDA tightened rules for coronavirus antibody tests, ordering manufacturers to submit emergency use authorization forms within 10 days.
Since the FDA issued its initial antibody test policy in mid-March, the agency said it has become aware of “a concerning number” of commercial serology tests being promoted inappropriately, including for diagnostic use, or performing poorly.

&gt;This is Abbott’s fourth Covid-19 test to win emergency use authorization. Abbott had already launched three coronavirus tests in the United States, including a rapid test that produces results in as little as five minutes and the newly released test that shows if a person has antibodies against the virus.
The company announced last month that it was working with CVS Health to get its tests “outside of the hospital” and into places like urgent-care clinics and nursing homes.

&gt;Abbott said the new test is more efficient and can provide more tests and take up less space, an important feature the company said for labs that process tens of thousands of patient samples but are often short on space.
It can exclude false positives 99.6% of the time and exclude false negatives 100% of the time for patients tested 14 days after symptoms began, the company said Monday.
It plans to submit for European CE mark approval this week.

This reversal happened during a month of 35% growth in auto sales in China as sales normalized post pandemic.

[Gasgoo](http://autonews.gasgoo.com/m/Detail/70017135.html)

It appears that Tesla sales in China are hurting both from the market share of EVs generally but also from being overtaken by local companies like BYD, which sold more EVs than Tesla.


This weakness seems pretty troubling considering Tesla's commitments to pay $323 million starting in 2023 to maintain their Shanghai factory lease. Meanwhile, Tesla had to drop prices to get below subsidy thresholds and China plans to drop the ceiling another 20% next year.

Here is the confusing part. They are apparently issuing new stocks at the price of 1 NOK in a few days, and it is possible for me to sign up to buy shares at this price. However, the current stock price is over 5 NOK, and had been rising, even after the news of this has been out. This doesn't add up for me? What am I missing? Why is the price rising if they will sell a Lot of shares in a few days at a very low cost? Will I really be able to buy at this price? This doesn't seem right, and I am sure there is something I haven't understood. Will the current shares be split into shares of equal value?

t3_ghtk6z,Thoughts on ALLY Financial?,"Hello all,

I was wondering what people in this subreddit were thinking of ALLY financial. I am no customer (not even US based) but I have heard good things about its daily business demeanor and general customer satisfaction. This is why I started looking into it and after checking out its yearly report and latest quarterly I have started considering it.

Obviously ALLYs biggest problem is its exposure to auto loans, with sub prime loans being a major risk (although only accounting for 11% of its portfolio if I remember correctly). The way they handled this crisis by reaching out to customers to allow delayed payments, actually stopping share buybacks but still offering dividend, makes me quite confident in the companies attitude.

The biggest concerns I probably have are that their second quarter will probably also be horrible and the fact that many people have raised concerns about the companies earlier history with auto loans around 2008 where they were in quite some distress. 

Does anyone have  more insights or has been following the company? If things were getting  better quickly I think this would be quite a safe bet.

t3_ghyivc,How to calculate hypothetical cumulative return using historical data,"I want to calculate the hypothetical cumulative return for various mutual funds. I cannot find a calculator online that will let me look farther than the previous 10 years. So, I found annual percent returns on Yahoo Finance, [example](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FSCSX/performance?p=FSCSX), and I put the data in Excel. For fund FSCSX (provided in the link), I'm looking at the annual percent return between 1986-2019.  I just took the previous year's value and multiplied by the annual percent return for x year. Example below

&amp;#x200B;

|Year|Annual % Return|Total Value|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1985|\-|$10,000|
|1986|13.86%|$11,386|
|1987|9.44%|$12,460|
|1988|9.05%|$13,588|

I got confused when I calculated the average annual return and compared it to the annualized return for FSCSX. They differ by 2% and obviously if I were to find a cumulative return using the same method as above just using either of the two percentages, the final value between the two would differ.

t3_gidrxl,I'm not understanding this stimulus,"So I understood the stimulus in 2008.  There was nothing fundamentally wrong with the economy, things were just messed up because a bunch of bankers f'd up and didn't understand what they were doing.  As a result, the market dropped, but it was just perception: there were still lots of jobs and the real economy was doing well.  It made sense to inject some money to overcome the disjoint between the real and financial economies which would have caused companies to fail and people to lose jobs.

This time is different.  Now, because of our reaction to a virus, millions are already out of work and thousands of companies are, or soon will be, out of business.  Without jobs, and with the changes in people's spending habits, the real economy will struggle to recover and may take decades.  My rudimentary knowledge of economics tells me that we need deflation to make people spend and start small businesses.  Instead, we're creating money (inflation) to prop up the big corporations and the stock market.  Isn't this to the detriment of consumers and small business?

What am I missing?  Isn't deflation what we need now?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Just wanted to add...  I get Keynesian economics and the purpose of stimulus, what I was questioning was the timing of the stimulus we've had.  I didn't get the point of jacking the financial economy while not allowing people to work and putting them in a situation where they have no incentive to spend (sitting home unemployed).  It seems to make more sense to allow the financial economy to contract to be a more accurate reflection of the economic output, THEN use stimulus to restart the economy when it can get people back to work.",investing,understanding stimulus,understood stimulus nothing fundamentally wrong economy thing messed bunch banker understand result market dropped perception still lot job real economy well made sense inject money overcome disjoint real financial economy would caused company fail people lose job time different reaction virus million already work thousand company soon business without job change people spending habit real economy struggle recover may take decade rudimentary knowledge economics tell need deflation make people spend start small business instead creating money inflation prop big corporation stock market detriment consumer small business missing deflation need edit wanted add get keynesian economics purpose stimulus questioning timing stimulus get point jacking financial economy allowing people work putting situation incentive spend sitting home unemployed seems make sense allow financial economy contract accurate reflection economic output use stimulus restart economy get people back work,understanding stimulus understood stimulus nothing fundamentally wrong economy thing messed bunch banker understand result market dropped perception still lot job real economy well made sense inject money overcome disjoint real financial economy would caused company fail people lose job time different reaction virus million already work thousand company soon business without job change people spending habit real economy struggle recover may take decade rudimentary knowledge economics tell need deflation make people spend start small business instead creating money inflation prop big corporation stock market detriment consumer small business missing deflation need edit wanted add get keynesian economics purpose stimulus questioning timing stimulus get point jacking financial economy allowing people work putting situation incentive spend sitting home unemployed seems make sense allow financial economy contract accurate reflection economic output use stimulus restart economy get people back work

t3_gi21lm,"High-risk, High-reward: Allogene (ALLO) Could Double in Value, with Catalysts This Week","**POSITIVE UPDATE:** ALLO is up **&gt;40%** after-hours today on positive safety data and preliminary efficacy data that shows high objective response rate (ORR). More information will be presented on the 5/29 readout. We have adjusted our positions. 

**Summary:** Allogene is a \~$4B market cap clinical stage biotech company developing allogeneic (‘off the shelf’) CAR-T therapies for hematologic cancers and solid tumor indications. Allogene was founded in 2018 by Arie Belldegrun and David Chang, who previously led Kite Pharma to the Yescarta approval and an $11.9 B acquisition by Gilead. While the current high price point presents risks, 2020 will be a critical year for Allogene with multiple early-stage readouts: this presents an opportunity to ride several key value inflection points over the next 6 - 12 months

**Key Takeaways**

* There is a lot to like about the experience the Allogene team brings to the table and the promise of their platform to address the clinical and commercial shortcomings of current marketed CAR-T therapies
* Allogene plans to initiate an abbreviated P1 trial for ALLO-501A in 2Q20 to confirm the results of the ALLO-501 P1 ALPHA trial, results for which will be presented this month at ASCO, prior to potentially advancing ALLO-501A to pivotal P2 development
* If the lead program in NHL (ALLO-501/ALLO-501A) is successful, that represents in the range of 100% upside using Kite Pharma, another CAR-T company, as an analogue
* Kite Pharma was valued at $8.4B prior to the Gilead acquisition with a filed BLA in NHL for Yescarta, double what Allogene is trading at today: given a high PTRS for Allogene’s program in NHL (rationale outlined below), this represents directionally where we would expect Allogene’s value to land in the future
* However, current market cap of &gt;$4 B constrains achievable upside versus the downside risk if near-term value clinical catalysts go against our expectation

*We are taking a modest (1 - 2% of portfolio) position ahead of the two key clinical readouts on 5/13 and 5/29 given our expectation for positive P1 results for ALLO-501 (ALPHA trial) and the 2Q20 initiation of P1/P2 ALPHA2 trial for ALLO-501A based on the following:*

* Strong preliminary P1 safety and efficacy data was presented in 2018 by for UCART19 in ALL, which is the same molecular design as ALLO-501
* ALLO-501/ALLO-501A target CD-19 in NHL patients, which is the same target as the approved CAR-T’s Kymriah and Yescarta in an overlapping patient population (DLBCL, a subtype of NHL), defraying clinical risk
* Allogene will be taking the dose-finding learnings from the ALPHA trial into the ALPHA2 trials for ALLO-501A, the next-generation construct and P2 candidate in NHL, a switchover that has been planned since before the ALPHA trial was initiated
* In an earnings call on 05/06, Allogene CEO David Chang indicated that the abbreviated P1 portion of ALPHA2 is on track to begin 2Q20, ahead of a potential pivotal P2 portion
* However, the current price point is somewhat overvalued, and thus does not support us taking a larger position given the potential downside is substantial and potential gains partially already baked in

**Key Stock Drivers:**

* ***High unmet clinical need:*** substantial need for accessible and efficacious therapies remains in NHL &amp; other hematological malignancies given limited options for r/r patients and the time-consuming and burdensome process required for current CAR-Ts
* ***‘Off the shelf’ CAR-T therapies address shortcomings of current CAR-Ts***\*\*:\*\* the approach would theoretically mitigate the manufacturing issues that continue to drag down the commercial potential of and patient access to existing autologous CAR-T’s
* ***Several critical near-term inflection points in 2020:*** ASCO poster abstract covering initial P1 data for ALLO-501 in r/r NHL (ALPHA trial) will be released on 05/13, with further data including additional patients presented on 5/29. These data will support the ALPHA2 P1 and potential pivotal P2 trial for ALLO-501A, their next-generation construct for NHL. Initial P1 data for ALLO-715 in r/r MM (UNIVERSAL trial) remains on track for 4Q20 despite impact of COVID-19
* ***Experienced leadership team with track record of rapid development and regulatory success in cell therapy:*** CEO David Chang and Executive Chairman Arie Belldegrun were formerly CMO and CEO of Kite Pharma, respectively, and led Yescarta, one of two CAR-T’s on market today, to FDA priority review prior to acquisition by Gilead for $11.9 B (29.4% premium over market close prior to announcement)
* ***Clinical programs focus largely on proven targets:*** ALLO-501/ALLO-501A and UCART19 are anti-CD19 therapies, which is the same target as the approved autologous CAR-Ts Yescarta and Kymriah, which somewhat de-risks these programs. Additional targets in development include BCMA for MM (ALLO-715, including in combination with nirogacestat in collaboration with SpringWorks)
* ***Preliminary UCART19 data offers additional validation of platform:*** preliminary pooled data from P1 trials in ALL indicated that 14/17 (82%) of patients receiving an anti-CD52 antibody during lymphodepletion achieved a complete response (CR/CRi). The anti-CD52 antibody serves to protect the allogeneic CAR-T’s from being cleared by the body’s immune system. ALLO-501, ALLO-501A, and ALLO-715 are all dosed with ALLO-647, Allogene’s internally developed anti-CD52 antibody, creating a “window of persistence” during which the allogeneic CAR-T’s can exert their therapeutic effect

**Key Stock Risks:**

* ***Value of pipeline programs heavily interdependent:*** Given the clinical stage therapies are rooted in the same technology platform, any issues that emerge from the ALPHA or UNIVERSAL trials could feasibly drag down the value of the entire pipeline. On the flipside, however, positive preliminary ALPHA data would likely have the reverse effect of increasing PTRS across the clinical-stage portfolio
* ***Stock currently trading at / near 52 week high:*** While Allogene traded in the $18 - 20 range for the latter part of March, the price has rebounded steadily upwards and scraped against an all-time high today on just-shy of average volume, reflecting both the overall market rebound and likely enthusiasm from the market for the impending ASCO data. This suggests there is significant immediate downside if the data falls short of expectations on 5/13 and 5/29
* ***Long-term competitive risk is substantial:*** While Allogene is a leader in the field, the next-generation CAR-T space is fairly crowded. In addition, Fate Therapeutics (market cap: $2.3 B) has a pipeline of iPSC-derived natural killer and T cell therapies for hematologic malignancies and solid tumors reaching the clinic. While Allogene is exploring the iPSC space as mentioned above, Fate Tx has reached the clinic already, which may provide them with a leg-up in the long-run

Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater and quite a big name in the investment community, is currently writing a new book. In this book, he describes the rise and fall of empires and tries to model archetypical sequences of such events.

He is currently releasing chapters for free outlining the study and giving an introduction to the topic and some context to the important concepts he will later use. ([Link to articles](https://www.principles.com/the-changing-world-order/))

In the latest article, he is explaining the debt cycles and how they work.   


Short-term deb cycle: smaller economic expansions and contractions which typically last around 8 years.

Long-term debt cycle: big economic contractions and debt-restructuring like the great depression.

Video made by him explaining this much more eloquently than I ever could: [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0)

**Main point:**

Reading through the article I stumbled upon this gem about when the long-term debt cycle is ending:

&gt;More specifically, the ability of central banks to be stimulative ends when the central bank loses its ability to produce money and credit growth that pass through the economic system to produce real economic growth.  

This is very much in line with what we are seeing right now. Asset prices go up but the economy is not really ""stimulated"".

t3_ghtk76,How is investing in gold not an unintentional ponzi scheme?,"So when you ask someone why they are investing in gold they typically say it is an inflation hedge or it is a low risk asset. Now why is it an inflation hedge? Because if the money supply increases ie inflation, people will see this, and go buy gold with the extra money...because it's an inflation hedge? Right? It only works as an inflation hedge if other people think it is an inflation hedge and treat it as such. So if we all agree it is an inflation hedge then it kind of is, but there's nothing fundamental about it that makes it an inflation hedge. You're not getting bullion for your basement, you own 1s and 0s on a server somewhere. 

Which brings me to my next point, it's good in times of crisis. It seems like the same circular logic of gold is good in times of crisis because people will flock to gold because it's stable because...people go to it in times of crisis. But why are you investing it in gold? What is it about an atom with 79 protons that makes it good to hold in a time of crisis? Let's imagine you do receive the delivery (lets talk storage costs as a drag on your return too). Ok so you have gold. A crisis hits. Real bad. The dollar is wiped out! Good thing you have gold. Ok what next? What scenario exists where this gold is now worth having, where does it derive it's worth? Will people just naturally regress to gold as the store of value just because that's what people did in the past? Then forget the scenario where your gold is in 1s and 0s, in the scenario where you need to spend actual gold you're not getting that metal no matter how you think you own it.

Am I missing something here? It basically feels like everyone sees gold as the global back up currency and because they're all in it together (and telling others) this keeps it working that way. There's no central bank or political authority to back this faith either like there is with USD.

The value of gold should be determined the same way as copper, demand for use in production of goods and services. It is no different than every other commodity except that because it didnt tarnish in the past and it's shiny and pretty, we for some reason treat it different.",investing,investing gold unintentional ponzi scheme,ask someone investing gold typically say inflation hedge low risk asset inflation hedge money supply increase inflation people see buy gold extra money inflation hedge right work inflation hedge people think inflation hedge treat agree inflation hedge kind nothing fundamental make inflation hedge getting bullion basement server somewhere brings next point good time crisis seems like circular logic gold good time crisis people flock gold stable people time crisis investing gold atom proton make good hold time crisis let imagine receive delivery let talk storage cost drag return gold crisis hit real bad dollar wiped good thing gold next scenario exists gold worth derive worth people naturally regress gold store value people past forget scenario gold scenario need spend actual gold getting metal matter think missing something basically feel like everyone see gold global back currency together telling others keep working way central bank political authority back faith either like usd value gold determined way copper demand use production good service different every commodity except didnt tarnish past shiny pretty reason treat different,investing gold unintentional ponzi scheme ask someone investing gold typically say inflation hedge low risk asset inflation hedge money supply increase inflation people see buy gold extra money inflation hedge right work inflation hedge people think inflation hedge treat agree inflation hedge kind nothing fundamental make inflation hedge getting bullion basement server somewhere brings next point good time crisis seems like circular logic gold good time crisis people flock gold stable people time crisis investing gold atom proton make good hold time crisis let imagine receive delivery let talk storage cost drag return gold crisis hit real bad dollar wiped good thing gold next scenario exists gold worth derive worth people naturally regress gold store value people past forget scenario gold scenario need spend actual gold getting metal matter think missing something basically feel like everyone see gold global back currency together telling others keep working way central bank political authority back faith either like usd value gold determined way copper demand use production good service different every commodity except didnt tarnish past shiny pretty reason treat different

t3_ghr3pc,Life direction- anxiety over investing in Real Estate,"Hi, I'm early thirties, single, California.

\~2.38mm net worth

$200k invested in REITs

$270k invested in market ETFs

$160k in cash

$1,750,000 in diversified individual stocks

I live off income from the above, \~$44,000k / year.

I live in a car, and generally satisfied. I've been floating around for the past 4 years, traveling domestically, and a little bit abroad. The recent corona thing forced me to temporarily move back home with my mentally unstable mother. Although I'm now back on the road and things are better, my view on life has changed slightly and I feel like it may be a prudent move to have somewhere to go when I'm not out on the road. I had a rough upbringing with my mentally unstable mother and generally have a negative view of Real Estate and prefer to be ""nomadic"" or out on the road.

I've been looking at real estate lately and have mentally prepared my self to sell about 200k in either the ETFs or the REITs to increase my cash to $365k in order to buy some land. I can't stop thinking about whether this is the right move.

I'm thinking about some land in CA because it is close to my friends. All or most of the properties within this budget means that they would mostly be raw land, possibly with a well, maybe a storage structure, manufactured, some or none of these improvements. They are generally zoned rural, rural residential, or agricultural.

It's a dramatic change for me in terms of lifestyle because I would have less cash, and less dividend income. But in exchange, I would have a 10-50 acre land, with possibly some improvements.

One of the problems for me valuing the net benefit of this change, is whether A. the financials make sense, and B. if this suits my lifestyle.

I'm worried about the land being worth much less than what I paid for it in the future, and B. would I even enjoy the change in lifestyle. For example, what would I realistically be doing with the land? I don't have any great idea for its purpose other than a safe haven for me away from my mentally unstable mother and using it for gatherings, storage, and projects.

I've thought about doing creative projects such as improving the land, (treehouse, a warehouse, a tinyhome), but the thought of the permits and interaction with contractors make me anxious, since laying foundation, a prefab structure, and erection crew could cost nearly 50-100k and that would eat into my savings, and I have no experience with any of this.  Also, I think I want no more than 15% of my net worth ($350k) in Real Estate. (I would like to to stay diversified).

How risky is raw land with a few improvements in California?

If I buy raw land in CA for $350k, add $100k of improvements, is there a possibility of me going to sell 5 years down the line, and losing money/getting less than the sum of the parts (or $450k)?

Does anybody have any words of advice for me? I never thought about buying land before this Corona thing started.

Per WSJ

BlackRock will steer as much as $750 billion into the corporate debt market for the Fed.

BlackRock is acting as a fiduciary to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,” a firm spokesman said in a written statement.

BlackRock will execute this mandate at the sole discretion of the Bank, and in accordance with their detailed investment guidelines,” he said, “in order to provide broad support to credit markets and achieve the government’s objective of supporting access to credit for US employers and supporting the American economy.

The Fed had said it would intervene substantially in money-market funds, and would shift its purchases of Treasury bills toward a broader range of maturities. Then on March 23 it unveiled sweeping measures. It said it would purchase all kinds of bonds, pledging to do whatever was needed to shore up the economy.

The Fed first focused on the highest-rated companies, those least likely to default. It wrestled with a question: What about companies that would be highly rated except that coronavirus-related troubles had cut them to junk? Would it be right to leave them out? When the Fed said on April 9 it would buy fallen-angel bonds too, its word sparked a bond rally long before any Fed buying.

As part of its role, BlackRock would buy bond ETFs.

Who audits the 10k? If anyone? I’m aware the financial side , that’s pretty cut and dry (relatively at least, in my mind)

But the risk factors for example, now Elon musk is mentioned as a risk factor in the filing but the way it is worded is more geared toward him being such an integral part of the operation. Now I know that is true, but what is omitted in the explanation of the subheadline is the fact that Elon is a little bit of a loose cannon. It could be strongly argued that musks actions on twitter and in interviews have cost the shareholders money, so having a proven risk in the past and having that risk not mentioned in the risk factors... who’s job is that to be like “hey Tesla, you might want to revisit this section before you submit this.” 


Or should I be reading the 10 k with more of a cynical mind frame? I know it’s an investors relations guide submitted by the company regulated by the sec, but it seems so trustworthy for lack of a better word. Should I have my guard up when I’m reading these filings ?

t3_ghd0lb,Benjamin Graham’s views on buying gold during times of extreme inflation,"Prefix:

I have been browsing this subreddit and many others and often come across many posts or comments advising to buy bitcoin, gold, or other assets which are seen as store of value investments. While we often feel our time is unique, it is important to remember that there is rarely a situation we come across which does not allow lessons from the past. As such, I strongly encourage you to consider the below arguments put forward by Benjamin Graham in his book The Intelligent Investor. 

Why should you care what some dead investor from the 70’s thinks about our current situation? The intelligent investor is often considered the greatest book on investment ever written. It is Wareen Buffet’s (former richest man on earth) favorite book and has yet to be proven wrong through over 50 years of investments. I strongly encourage anyone who has not read this book but wants to invest and build their own wealth to read it cover to cover.

Alternatives to Common Stocks as Inflation Hedges

The standard policy of people all over the world who mistrust their currency has been to buy and hold gold. This has been against the law for American citizens since 1935–luckily for them. In the past 35 years the price of gold in the open market has advanced from $35 an ounce to $48 in early 1972–a rise of only 35%. But during all this time the holder of gold has received no income return on his capital, and instead has incurred some annual expense for storage. Obviously, he would have done better with his money at interest in a savings bank, in spite of the rise in the general price level.

The near-complete failure of hold to protect against a loss in the purchasing power of the dollar must cast grave doubt on the ability of the ordinary investor to protect himself against inflation by putting his money in “things.”* Quite a few categories of valuable objects have had striking advances in market value over the years—such as diamonds, paintings by masters, first editions of books, rare stamps, and counts, etc. But in many, perhaps most, of these cases there seems to be an element of the artificial or the precarious or even the unreal about the quoted prices. Somehow it is hard to think of paying $67,500 for a US silver dollar dated 1804 (but not even minted that year) as an “investment operation.” We acknowledge we are out of our depth in this area. Very few of our readers will find the swimming safe and easy there.

The outright ownership of real estate has long been considered as a sound long-term investment, carrying with it a goodly amount of protection against inflation. Unfortunately, real-estate values are also subject to wide fluctuations; serious errors can be made in location, price paid, etc.; there are pitfalls in salesmen’s wiles. Finally, diversification is not practical for the investor of moderate means, except by various types of participation’s with others and with the special hazards that attach to new flotations— not too different from common-stock ownership. This too is not our field. All we should say to the investor is, “be sure it is yours before you go into it.”

t3_ghiphy,Types of property to make most money ?,"Background:

I live in Southern California

Single as of now (meaning; no one to go in on property with)

Live at home and saving, looking to move out within the next few years.

Take home $2300 every 2 weeks = ~60k a year after taxes 

I've worked at the aforementioned job for 7 months and saved 17k (I paid off 10k in loans also and now debt free)

Question:

Which would be the better option:

1) use current and future savings (within a year) to outright buy a house out of state and rent out and become a slumlord 

Or 

2) continue saving for 3 to 4 more years and afford a house to live in of my own


Essentially it comes down to: use savings to buy rental property and use rental income to supplement my own or keep saving and eventually buy place of my own locally.


3rd bonus option is to buy a local duplex/triplex and live in 1 unit and rent out the other(s) until able to move out.


Basically I'm confused on which type of property investment to invest upon.

t3_gh0vg3,Looking into making a small BDC portfolio,"I've been eyeing some well established BDC's with either a decent track record or leadership with experience. I am anticipating BDC's to be taking major hits on loan repayments but once things start leveling out later in the year, most of the level headed BDC's will expand and grow without being greedy.

t3_gh1nfq,A case for the market being appropriately valued,"I've seen a lot of posts about how the market is too high and it doesn't make sense.  Here are some perspectives for why things are bad and should be down from January, but also why things aren't so bad that we should be at 2008 levels.

1.  About 75% of new unemployment is expected to be temporary.  This puts true unemployment levels at numbers that are obviously bad, but not 2008 level bad.
2.  Interest rates are at all time lows.  If you've taken a corporate finance class this would help explain the risk premium.  Assume most people see stocks as requiring an additional 5% return above the risk free rate.  If the risk free rate drops from 3% to 1%, your expected return from stocks drops from 8% to 6%.  When this happens, the price of stocks go up and not down.  To explain this, assume we have a company that only pays out 100% of profits as dividends.  Under the old normal, you'd pay $100 for a stock and expect $8 in dividends every year (an 8% return).  Now the question is, how much would you pay for the same stock if it earns -$8 this year and $8 per year after that, but you now demand only a 6% return.  The formula becomes $8 in perpetuity minus the immediate change for this year of $16 or $8/.06 - $16 = $117.33.  Obviously, these are made up numbers to illustrate a point.  That point is, prices go up when interest rates go down.  If you want to make the formula more complex, assume low interest rates for 5 years then back to the higher level after that, which may be more representative of the current environment.
3.  The Fed is backstopping everything.  What this essentially means is that the money printing machine in America is issuing loans.  If these loans are paid back, then the Fed will earn money on its investment and we will have deflation.  However, the Fed can simply print more money to help avoid deflation.  The other side of this equation, would be that the Fed invests poorly and loses money.  Now, we instead have inflation which the Fed can then stop printing money to a certain extent.  Assuming they lose grip and inflation becomes quite high, this is also good for most stocks, especially in a nominal sense.  Stocks are generally a decent inflation hedge, not the best, but decent.
4.  Government debt is also hitting new highs.  However, we are literally issuing debt at a rate lower than our targeted inflation number.  Of course the government could spend it in ways that do not contribute to the economy at all.  However, they need to do the bare minimum to provide out performance relative to the rates they will borrow at.
5.  Due to the combination of 3 and 4 above, it is unlikely there will be a massive liquidity issue.  These are where the market crashes really come into play.  If there is no one to provide money to people, then investors start demanding very high risk premiums because money becomes very high demand.  This would influence number 2 in the opposite direction and make stocks go down.  All in all, I believe a liquidity scenario is possible but very unlikely, which is why I advocate for at least putting a majority of your cash in the market instead of waiting for a pullback.  However, hold a little cash in case there is a larger market issue.
6.  Larger businesses represent a majority of the publicly traded companies.  However, small businesses are hurt the most from the current crisis.  This one makes me very sad, but it is one of the reasons things don't look as bad in stocks.",investing,case market appropriately valued,seen lot post market high make sense perspective thing bad january also thing bad level new unemployment expected temporary put true unemployment level number obviously bad level bad interest rate time low taken corporate finance class would help explain risk premium assume people see stock requiring additional return risk free rate risk free rate drop expected return stock drop happens price stock explain assume company pay profit dividend old normal pay stock expect dividend every year return question much would pay stock earns year per year demand return formula becomes perpetuity minus immediate change year obviously made number illustrate point point price interest rate want make formula complex assume low interest rate year back higher level may representative current environment fed backstopping everything essentially mean money printing machine america issuing loan loan paid back fed earn money investment deflation however fed simply print money help avoid deflation side equation would fed invests poorly loses money instead inflation fed stop printing money certain extent assuming lose grip inflation becomes quite high also good stock especially nominal sense stock generally decent inflation hedge best decent government debt also hitting new high however literally issuing debt rate lower targeted inflation number course government could spend way contribute economy however need bare minimum provide performance relative rate borrow due combination unlikely massive liquidity issue market crash really come play one provide money people investor start demanding high risk premium money becomes high demand would influence number opposite direction make stock believe liquidity scenario possible unlikely advocate least putting majority cash market instead waiting pullback however hold little cash case larger market issue larger business represent majority publicly traded company however small business hurt current crisis one make sad one reason thing look bad stock,case market appropriately valued seen lot post market high make sense perspective thing bad january also thing bad level new unemployment expected temporary put true unemployment level number obviously bad level bad interest rate time low taken corporate finance class would help explain risk premium assume people see stock requiring additional return risk free rate risk free rate drop expected return stock drop happens price stock explain assume company pay profit dividend old normal pay stock expect dividend every year return question much would pay stock earns year per year demand return formula becomes perpetuity minus immediate change year obviously made number illustrate point point price interest rate want make formula complex assume low interest rate year back higher level may representative current environment fed backstopping everything essentially mean money printing machine america issuing loan loan paid back fed earn money investment deflation however fed simply print money help avoid deflation side equation would fed invests poorly loses money instead inflation fed stop printing money certain extent assuming lose grip inflation becomes quite high also good stock especially nominal sense stock generally decent inflation hedge best decent government debt also hitting new high however literally issuing debt rate lower targeted inflation number course government could spend way contribute economy however need bare minimum provide performance relative rate borrow due combination unlikely massive liquidity issue market crash really come play one provide money people investor start demanding high risk premium money becomes high demand would influence number opposite direction make stock believe liquidity scenario possible unlikely advocate least putting majority cash market instead waiting pullback however hold little cash case larger market issue larger business represent majority publicly traded company however small business hurt current crisis one make sad one reason thing look bad stock

t3_ghkv0o,There's a huge misconception about dividends,"Selling stocks is not the same as earning dividend in the grand scheme of things. I'm quoting this post:

*Let me ELI55 this.*

*Suppose a person is 55 years old and retired. They are no longer saving for retirement. They are in retirement. They now want to take out cash every couple of weeks for spoiling their grandchildren, for travel, and for medical care.*

*Way 1: buy dividend-paying stocks. The stocks pay dividends in cash. Don't re-invest the dividends, just withdraw some every so often. Commission cost: $0.*

*Way 2: buy non-dividend-paying growth stocks. Sell a little bit of stock every so often. Commission cost: 1 commission on every sale.*

*When I started trading, I paid $50 a trade for commissions. At a discount broker. At that time, Way 2 would have been too expensive for a retired person. So, at that time, people fussed more about dividends. Now with $0 commissions, people don't have to do that.*



If you keep selling shares, you'll eventually run out of shares. But you won't run out of dividends because you still have the same amount of shares (assuming dividends aren't cut obviously).

The whole point of not being too focused on dividends is because you could theoretically generate more returns through stock appreciation, for various reasons. BUT, the nuance is that financing yourself with stock sales isn't the same as earning dividends.

t3_ggyqb7,Secret compounders,"Yesterday I  listened to this very interesting podcast ( We Study Billionaires - TIP295: Mohnish Pabrai on Value Investing &amp; Philanthropy) where Mohnish Pabrai mentions what he calls secret compounders. The concept sounds very interesting to me, the company that compounds earnings like Visa or Mastercard, but doesn't demand the premium yet, since market doesn't know it yet. He mentions his investment in Fiat - Chrysler (FCAU) where he thought that Ferrari (RACE) alone is worth the whole company due to this reason. I have been thinking about it since yesterday, but I couldn't think of any. I also tried to identify some requirements for such a company.

1. Low P/E: goal is obviously to find the ones that haven't appreciated in value yet, since Mr. Market doesn't know about or doesn't value their compounding ability yet. So they have to have earnings and P/E multiple growth potential. If they have high P/E I can just buy V or MA, where I am sure of their copounding ability.
2. Addresable market that they dominate and is also growing, enabling the future growth of the company.
3. High operating and net margin that signal strong moat and ability to earn a lot of money which they then reinvest in the bussines.
4. Scalability without increasing costs; costs percentage should be decreasing considerably with scale. Something like Saas is the best representation of this.
5. Reinvested earnings are effective at raising revenue. If company is just investing a lot of money, but there is no growth, then they lack compounding ability imo (like IBM for example).

These are just a few points that I am not even sure that apply so I would like to get your opinion.

What criteria should we use to figure our if the company is a secret compunder? And do you have any ideas which companies would that be and why?

To me, the closest I could think of is Cisco (CSCO). They generate huge cash flow, have great balance sheet and pay nice and sustainable dividend. However, this doesn't make them a compunder, but just a nice company to invest in. Their shift from legacy business to Saas could make them one, but only if they are successful in making it a larger part of their revenue. This would increase their earnings power and also make their revenue more predictable, warranting P/E multiple expansion.

t3_ghfsxk,SpringWorks (SWTX): A Rare Cancer Biotech with Potentially &gt;50% Upside. Recommending BUY.,"Last week, we initiated a position in Springworks Therapeutics (NASDAQ: SWTX), and as promised, we’re providing our view on the company. 

**Summary:** Founded in 2017, Springworks is a $1.4B market cap biotech company developing targeted oncology therapies for rare tumor types with high unmet need. We like Springworks for several key reasons: 

* The company has two late-stage (Phase 2/3) programs, nirogacestat and mirdametinib, targeting rare tumor types with high unmet need (either insufficient therapies or no available therapies). Past trial data gives us confidence in their chances of approval, and we expect these candidates to be approved in 2022 and 2023 respectively, upon which they will become first-in-class drugs in their respective indications through their differentiated clinical profiles. 
* Springworks has signed collaborations with major biotech companies to develop several interesting early stage assets in additional oncology indications, providing a degree of validation of Springworks’ assets and creating a future growth runway. 
* We anticipate several value-creating milestones over the next year, namely topline data from nirogacestat’s registrational Phase 3 trial in mid-2021 and an interim update from mirdametinib’s registrational Phase 2b in 1Q21. 
* Our DCF analysis assigns Springworks a price target of $55, assuming an 85% probability of success for nirogacestat and mirdametinib in their main indications, and using an 11% discount rate and 2% terminal growth rate. 

**Company Background:** Springworks was established in 2017 as a spinoff from Pfizer, which provided the company with initial funding and the development rights to its 4 clinical assets. Springworks raised \~$230M from investors including Bain Capital and OrbiMed Advisors before going public in September 2019. 

**1. Late-stage Clinical Programs in Areas of High Unmet Need:** Springworks has two late stage programs currently in registrational or potentially registrational trials:

Nirogacestat. Nirogacestat is an oral, selective gamma secretase inhibitor developed to treat desmoid tumors. 

* *Desmoid tumors.* Desmoid tumors are highly morbid, soft tissue tumors with an estimated 6,000 patients being treated in the US every year. 
* *Unmet need.* Though survival rates for desmoid tumors are relatively high compared to other cancer types, desmoid tumors place a heavy burden on patients’ quality of life; they can interfere with the function of nearby structures (e.g. intestines), are painful to live with, and highly disfiguring. Treatment has traditionally been via surgical resection, but this method has been associated with recurrence rates of up to 70%. Chemotherapy and other targeted cancer therapies have been used off-label as well, but these have shown inconsistent efficacy and unfavorable safety profiles. 
* Nirogacestat has received FDA breakthrough and orphan drug designation.

Mirdametinib. Mirdametinib is an oral, selective MEK inhibitor developed to treat NF1-associate plexiform neurofibromas (NF1-PN). 

* *NF1-PN.* The NF1 gene produces neurofibromin, a protein that represses a key signaling pathway (RAS/MAPK) responsible for the growth of many cancers. When the NF1 gene is mutated, the loss of neurofibromin production allows this pathway to run unchecked, resulting in tumor growth across the body. There are \~100k NF1 patients in the US, and 30-50% of these patients can develop plexiform neurofibromas, which are tumors that grow along nerves. 
* *Unmet need.* NF1-PN are associated with extreme pain and disfigurement as well as interference with neurocognitive function. First-line therapy is usually surgical resection, but NF1-PN extensive growth patterns along nerves make them hard to completely remove (while risking nerve damage). 
* There is one approved MEK inhibitor for NF1-PN, AstaZeneca’s selumetinib, which was approved in April 2020. While the drug works, mirdametinib has demonstrated a potentially superior safety profile vs. selumetinib, which should allow patients to remain on therapy longer and experience more clinical benefit. 
* Mirdametinib has received FDA orphan drug designation. 

**2. Promising Clinical Data.** 

Nirogacestat. To date, nirogacestat has shown a promising clinical profile in its Phase 1 and 2 trials. The drug is currently enrolling patients in its Phase 3 trial, with progression free survival (PFS, a measure of how long patients live without their tumors growing &gt;20% in size) as the primary endpoint. 

* *Phase 1.* Nirogacestat achieved an objective response rate (ORR) of 71.4% in its 7-patient Phase 1 trial (5/7), and a 100% disease control rate (DCR). Patients were able to stay on the drug for a median of 49.5 months (at the time of publication, so possibly longer), and none went off treatment due to safety issues. 
* *Phase 2.* In a heavily pre-treated population (median 4 lines of prior therapy vs. 3 in Phase 1 i.e. sicker patients), nirogacestat again achieved a 100% DCR and a 29.4% ORR. More importantly, 59% of patients remained on drug for more than 2 years. The drug was well tolerated with only 1 patient discontinuing treatment due to side effects. 
* *Phase 3.* A 115-patient Phase 3 trial is currently enrolling patients. The trial is powered to show a 12-month difference in PFS vs. placebo, and past trials from a similar drug showed that 50% of placebo patients experience disease progression by 8 months, which compares favorably to what nirogacestat has demonstrated in its Phase 1/2 trials. 
* The Phase 3 trial is expected to readout in 2Q/3Q21 and we expect approval of nirogacestat in 2022. 

Mirdametinib.  

* *Phase 2.* In its Phase 2 trial, Mirdametinib demonstrated a 42% ORR in 8/19 patients. In contrast, selumetinib demonstrated a 74% ORR in its Phase 2 trial. Though selumetinib’s Phase 2 data was numerically superior to mirdametinib’s, we believe several factors artificially limited mirdametinib’s efficacy:
   * Selumetinib’s trial enrolled only children while mirdametinib’s trial included only patients 16 years or older. Tumors in younger children are considered to be more responsive to therapy than those in adults. 
   * Patients in the mirdametinib trial were removed from the trial if they did not show signs of benefit within 12 months, which may have limited the number responses; 30% of selumetinib’s patients did not respond until after 12 months on drug. 
* *Safety benefits.* In its Phase 2, only 5 out of 19 patients (26%) required dose reductions of mirdametinib. In contrast, in selumetinib’s Phase 1, 10 out of 24 patients (42%) required dose reductions due to toxicity issues. We believe that this is evidence that mirdametinib is a safer drug than selumetinib, which will be an important differentiating factor for doctors deciding between the two drugs. 
* *Phase 2b.* Springworks is currently enrolling patients for a 100-patient Phase 2b trial of mirdametinib (primary endpoint ORR) that could support approval in 2023. The trial will enroll an even split of pediatric and adult patients and will not remove patients before 12 months. We expect that mirdametinib will show a similar ORR to selumetinib and differentiate itself via a superior safety profile. 

**3. Intriguing Early Stage Programs.**

* **Nirogacestat for Multiple Myeloma Therapy.** Nirogacestat is also being evaluated as an add-on therapy to BCMA therapies for multiple myeloma, a cancer of the plasma cells with \~27k patients in the US every year. These drugs target a protein called BCMA on the surface of cancer cells, and preclinical data has shown that nirogacestat significantly upregulates the expression of BCMA on cancer cells and enhanced the potency of BCMA-targeting drugs. Springworks has already signed collaborations with Glaxo Smith Kline and Allogene Therapeutics to use nirogacestat in combination trials with their BCMA drugs. 
* **BGB-3245.** Springworks has also signed a collaboration agreement with Beigene, a leading China biotech company, to develop a novel cancer drug targeting BRAF-mutant solid tumors. BRAF is a validated oncology target that is clinically relevant in melanoma, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. BGB-3245 has been shown in preclinical models to be effective in inhibiting certain mutant forms of BRAF that currently approved BRAF inhibitors cannot target. A Phase 1 trial for BGB-3245 has been initiated in Australia. 

**4. Strong Balance Sheet:** As of the end of 2019, Springworks had \~$330M in cash and no debt. This is expected to be sufficient to fund operations and support its 6 clinical trials through the end of 2022. The company has not indicated that its clinical development timelines have been impacted by Covid, but we will be on the lookout for any future guidance. 

**5. Experienced Leadership:** Springworks is led by a world-class management team with deep pharma industry experience. Selected leadership includes:

* Chief Executive Officer Saqib Islam is a founding member of the company and was formerly the Chief Business Officer at Moderna. Prior to Moderna, he held senior leadership roles at Alexion Pharmaceuticals (a $20B rare disease biotech).
* Chief Medical Officer Jens Renstrup was formerly Head of Medical Affairs at Alexion, where he was instrumental in building out its pipeline. Prior to Alexion, he led medical affairs at Glaxo Smith Kline’s vaccine division. 
* Head of R&amp;D Stephen Squinto is a venture partner at OrbiMed, a highly respected life science investment firm. He is also a co-founder of Alexion, where he led global operations and R&amp;D for over 20 years. 

**6. Risks.** Potential investors should be aware that Springworks is exposed to the following key risks as a biotech company:

* *Clinical development risk.* Springworks’ assets could fail their clinical trials due to unfavorable or uncompetitive clinical data and/or unexpected safety issues. 
* *Competitive risk.* Springworks’ drugs could be leapfrogged by more effective drugs, severely limiting their commercial potential. 
* *Financial risk.* Unexpected costs/circumstances could lead to the company running out of cash and having to raise dilutive capital and/or shut down.

t3_ggj2i0,Deflation is bad for stocks,"To fill the hole in GDP and liquidity crunch caused by corona, the Fed and Treasury pumped in several trillion more than the estimated fall in GDP. Of these trillions, about 2.5 trillion at most was income given to businesses and individual by Treasury. This is more than 10% of annual GDP should more than fill the hole in GDP by most estimates. The rest was in the form of Fed printing and unforgivable loans. This was to offset the capital flight to safe havens like cash and treasuries and restore liquidity to bond markets. Inadvertently, a portion of this government provided income and Fed printing ended up in stocks. Consensus says that since the amount pumped in as income and loans is greater than the fall in GDP and capital flight to safe havens, the recession is cancelled or there's a Fed put on stocks not specifically doomed or even helped by corona (FAANG, etc).

Note that while stocks have rallied, short term t-bill yields are still falling and long term treasury yields are flat after falling a lot, despite record borrowing by Treasury. Gold is flat since stocks bottomed on March 23rd. Fed futures are expecting negative interest rates. Investment grade bond yields are much lower. All of this means that smart investors expect deflation, not inflation, for several years. This is while the Fed funds rate is already at zero.

Deflation is bad for stocks, good for bonds. It doesn't matter if you own the stock of a perfect monopoly with zero debt. If your money can earn a return as cold hard cash, why would you buy stock of a business that will have lower earnings due to deflation? Yes monopolies have pricing power, but this will diminish if there's deflation and could cause a revenue/income drop. Also, deflation increases the real yield on treasuries/bonds, so stocks make less sense as an investment. So why are stocks not pricing in deflation when every other investment asset is?

Stock investors are stupider and more impulsive than bond investors. This has never been more true than in the current age of instant gratification (social media), investment gamification (investing apps), index investing (blind and constant buying), and an 11 year, 500% stock rally that gave investors confidence in stocks and a FOMO. The trillion dollar question is, how long can all this keep stocks diverging from reality? I think over the next month, as Fed printing slows, government income tapers, and people go back to work, we'll see the top.

t3_gga013,The new age of Monetary Policy: an in-depth analysis of Federal Reserve Policy in the 2008 and 2020 financial crises,"**The Evolution of Monetary Policy: Age of the Bailout**

In the years leading up to 2008 Wall Street had been celebrating massive gains; top finance executives were awarded up to $53 billion dollars in total compensation in 2007. Lloyd Blankfein, former CEO of Goldman Sachs, made $68 million himself. These profits were the result of financial innovations and financial derivatives, specifically mortgage backed securities (MBS). A mortgage backed security is an asset backed security which is secured by a collection of mortgages. The mortgages are aggregated and securitized so that investors can buy them and receive periodic payments similar to a bond’s coupon payment. Mortgage backed securities were doing so well in the years leading up to 2008 that lenders were running out of people with good credit to lend to. Everyone was buying and building houses so much so that the real estate market became a bubble and all the prices inflated.

At first everyone was celebrating the gains in housing prices, since price increases generally meant profits for home investors, mortgage brokers, and even big banks. Not too long after the party, the real estate bubble burst. Everyone was immediately impacted; mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were on the verge of bankruptcy. Some of the biggest investment banks in the world, each having upwards of $10 trillion assets under management, such as Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch were about to collapse. The whole financial sector was in shambles. “In a period of 18 months, Wall Street had gone from celebrating its most profitable age to finding itself on the brink of an epochal devastation.” Banks were heavily involved with mortgage securities. Most of these securities were financial derivatives which means they derive their price from an underlying asset. “Banks were creating increasingly complex products, many levels removed from the underlying asset.”

The first bank to really be shallow waters was Bear Stearns. Bear Stearns was a global investment bank whose main area of business was capital markets, wealth management, and investment banking. In 2008 Bear Stearns had roughly $13 trillion in derivative financial instruments, $2 trillion of which were in options and futures contracts. The company had a highly leveraged balance sheet with a lot of illiquid assets that were potentially worthless. Bear Stearns was the seventh largest securities firm in the world. Since their business was highly intertwined with other huge financial institutions, their potential collapse would be detrimental for the global economy.

U.S. Treasury secretary Hank Paulson knew that if Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers collapsed there would be a domino effect across the financial sector and other huge financial institutions such as Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, and others would fail while consumers would start to lose confidence in the banking sector, more banks would be subject to bank-runs. In order to prevent the worst from occurring the U.S. Treasury Secretary put together a task force which included Jamie Dimon, CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase, Ben Bernake, Chairmen of the United States Federal Reserve, and Tim Geithner, Head of the New York Fed. After pondering possible loans and other solutions in order to rescue Bear Stearns, they deemed that there was no way to save Bear Stearns. This is not because of insufficient capital but because confidence had been lost in Bear Stearns. J.P. Morgan Chase ended up acquiring Bear Stearns for $10 a share, much less than their 52 week high of $133 per share.

After Bear Stearns fell the next bank about to collapse was Lehman Brothers. Lehman Brothers was the fourth largest investment bank in the United States. Its CEO at the time Richard Fuld blamed the declining stock price on short sellers. However the short sellers argued that the way Lehman viewed non-liquid assets such as mortgages was disturbing. Fuld refused to accept that the bank essentially had a bunch of junk mortgage backed securities on their balance sheets and tried to solve Lehman’s liquidity problem with more cash. He reached out to Warren Buffett to try and secure a loan, but Buffett said it was too risky. Richard even reached out to the U.S. government for a bailout, but Treasury Secretary at the time Henry Paulson refused to bail out Lehman with public tax payer money and instead said that the bank must secure funding from the private sector. Paulson gathered all the CEO’s of major banks and told them to come up with a solution for saving Lehman Brothers. Likely contenders to buy out Lehman Brothers were Bank of America and British bank, Barclays. However neither of which were willing to take on the Lehman’s real estate assets which were basically worth half of what Lehman was valuing them at. After failing to secure capital, or merge with another bank Lehman Brothers filed for chapter eleven bankruptcy protection on September 15th, 2008. Chapter eleven bankruptcy protected some creditors and most employees. In the bankruptcy agreement, Lehman Brothers’ shareholders paid the ultimate price and watched their fortunes from a year prior be worth a fraction of what they were.

At the same time Lehman Brothers was crashing, insurance giant American International Group (AIG) and mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were tumbling down cliffs of their own. James Lockhart, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) issued a plan to make the two mortgage giants into a conservatorship as government sponsored enterprises. The two mortgage companies were now and still are U.S. government enterprises who facilitate the secondary mortgage market. The United States Treasury Secretary, Hank Paulson, as well as Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke, both agreed with the housing agency's decision.

On the other hand, AIG executives were assuring everyone that the company was in sound financial standing. At the time, AIG had $1 trillion in assets and roughly $40 billion in cash. In addition, executives argued that they had an extremely profitable business supporting insurance on collateral debt obligations (CDO). A CDO is a financial tool that banks use to package individual homeowners, credit card, and auto loans into securities sold to investors on the market. CDOs at the time were mainly used to refinance mortgage backed securities.. Most of AIG’s business was traditional insurance products such as health, life, and home insurance. However during the real estate bubble the company began taking a lot of risks in the form of credit default swaps (CDS). A CDS is a financial exchange agreement where the issuer of the CDS will compensate the buyer if the buyer’s asset defaults (similar to investment insurance). Essentially investors were buying credit default swaps as insurance for their mortgage backed securities. Once the real estate bubble popped, everyone came to claim insurance for their MBS that just went bankrupt. AIG had over $500 billion in subprime mortgages on their balance sheet. Its officials were revaluing credit default swaps and losses started to pile up at AIG. By May of 2008 AIG had suffered a first quarter loss of roughly $8 billion, their largest loss ever. Hank Paulson knew that if AIG went bankrupt it would trigger the collapse of financial institutions that bought these credit default swaps.

As the MBS tied to the swaps defaulted, AIG was forced to come up with the capital to repay their investors. Shareholders started dumping their shares which made it even more difficult for AIG to produce the capital it needed. Even though they had the assets on their balance sheet to cover the losses, AIG could not liquidate them fast enough before the swaps were due. It was clear that they were about to go bankrupt. Hank Paulson and Ben Bernanke did not want AIG’s huge influence to hurt lower and middle class families since AIG sold lots bonds, annuities, and insurance products to these people. An AIG bankruptcy would’ve hurt lower and middle class families as well as the whole financial sector which owned credit default swaps issued by AIG. They were just too big to fail. So the Federal Reserve along with the U.S. Treasury planned a bailout of an $85 billion loan to AIG. To put that loan amount into perspective, “Eighty-five billion dollars was more than the annual budget of Singapore and Taiwan combined; who could understand a figure that size.”

The loan itself was not enough to calm the markets. Investors were left puzzled as to why the federal government would bailout one company and not the other. What were the rules for a bailout? Did Hank Paulson’s background as a top executive at Goldman Sachs have anything to do with the government allowing Lehman Brothers, a competitor of Goldman, to collapse? These questions forced Hank Paulson, Ben Bernanke, and Tim Geithner, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, to come up with a solution to calm confusion. Now with the whole financial sector on the verge of collapsing the Treasury and Federal Reserve came up with a fiscal policy to purchase toxic assets from nine of the largest financial institutions in order to stabilize them. The institutions include J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Bank of New York Mellon, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America, and State Street Corp. The program to bail them out was known as TARP. However congress was not too attached to the idea of bailing out Wall Street. Republicans saw a bailout as socialism creeping into the United States, and Democrats saw it as Paulson bailing out his Wall Street buddies. Congress voted against TARP and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell roughly 800 points that day.

Paulson, Bernanke, and Geithner went back to the drawing board. Now desperate for a solution Paulson decided to follow the advice of his assistant Neel Kashkari, which was to purchase equity in the nine largest banks in the United States. Paulson reached out to Sheila Bair who was the head of the Federal Depositors Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and told her about the Treasury Department’s new plan. Sheila agreed to increase the nine bank’s coverage limit.

Without wasting any time Hank Paulson, Treasury Secretary of the United States, called all the nine executives together for a meeting at the NY Federal Reserve. “It was the first time - perhaps the only time - that the nine most powerful CEOs in American Finance and the people who regulate them would be in the same room at the same time.” Without knowing what the meeting was about, the CEO’s of all nine banks had shown up. To stress the severity and seriousness of the meeting, Paulson had brought along with him the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the president of the NY Fed, and The head of the FDIC. Paulson unveiled his plan to purchase up to $250 million in preferred stock in the leading banks in order to stabilize them and restore confidence. He strong armed all of them into taking the deal even though a few of them claim that they did not need the capital, such as Wells Fargo and J.P. Morgan. He also informed the banks that the collapse of Lehman Brothers will spillover into other banks, Merrill Lynch was of most concern. Paulson agreed to let Merrill get bought out by Bank of America in order to save them. They were sold to Bank of America for $29 per share or $50 billion far from their 52 week high of $88 per share. The banks had agreed to the deal and so did Congress on October 3rd, 2008 President George Bush signed the TARP program into law. The program normalized the big banks and brought back investor confidence in Wall Street.

The following year, President Barack Obama introduced legislation that would transform the whole financial regulatory system. This act was known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. One specific provision known as the Volker rule forbids banks from making speculative investments that do not benefit their consumers. This type of overhaul has not been seen in the U.S. financial system since the Great Depression of 1929. In regards to the subprime mortgage crisis, the United States’ Congress, Treasury, and Federal Reserve acted appropriately however they should have acted more quickly and effectively like Jerome Powell’s Federal Reserve has during the COVID-19 crisis.

Some say because of the catastrophe in 2008 and the lessons we have learned, the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve acted the way they did in 2020. Thus far, they both have combated the current financial market crisis with immediate action. If the Federal Reserve and Treasury could’ve bailed out Bear Stearns, Lehman, AIG, and Merrill Lynch the way that they bailed out Boeing, that would have been the best case scenario. In March of 2020 Boeing Co. the airplane manufacturer went to Washington with its hands out begging for a bailout. The company had spent $50 billion on stock repurchases within the past year and now was asking for a $60 billion bailout. Instead of giving the company a direct handout, the Federal Reserve boosted liquidity in the credit markets by purchasing corporate bonds, thus, Boeing was able to secure $25 billion from private investors via the corporate bond market and withdrew its original request for a government bailout. Despite the 33 million unemployed, many people are applauding Jerome Powell and Steven Mnuchin for quickly passing emergency monetary policy measures. Like 2008, these policy measures have insulated the financial markets from total ruin.

t3_ggqq6j,What is the biggest missed investment opportunity or missed sell that haunts you to this day? How did you deal with it?,"Just curious if anyone wants to share the time when they could have made a lot of profit and didn't pull the trigger. I'm not talking about saying you could have bought Tesla ipo unless you literally had your finger on the button and didn't push it. I mean regrets about moves that were in your hands and you lost out on a lot. What is your advice on how to live with those regrets? And with investing the worst part is not just the lack of profit, but realizing what you could have done with the profit if you had secured it and reinvested which makes what you lost out on wind up being theoretically much much more.

t3_gfw84z,Why the stock market is going up even as unemployment goes up,"I know many of us here are confused by the apparent disconnect between the market and real boots on the ground economy. A report just came out showing over 20.5 million Americans lost their jobs in April. We're now at a a top level unemployment rate of 14.7%. The Dow is up over 350 points as I type this.

What CNBC and other media outlets won't tell you in their hacky ""[Why the stock market is up even with historic job losses](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/08/why-the-market-is-up-even-with-historic-job-losses.html)"" articles, is that quite a few public companies can weather the storm, while many main street businesses will close permanently. In other words, large corporations are essentially ""buying out"" these small businesses in the long run. Throw in automation and an increasingly specialized workforce, and we are witnessing the acceleration of the 4th industrial revolution, which ultimately benefits Wall Street.

While everyone's distracted with bitter partisan politics, global mortality leaderboards and the usual nonsense in popular media, the largest wealth exchange in history is going completely unnoticed right under our noses. I don't think many of us plebs can appreciate the magnitude of what's going on. If I was a conspiracy theorist, which I most definitely am not, I would say they couldn't have dreamt up a more perfect scenario for the wholesale theft of main street businesses.

The day trader, working from his house in a Toronto suburb, figured he couldn’t lose as he spent $2,400 snapping up crude at $3.30 a barrel, and then 50 cents. Then came what looked like the deal of a lifetime: buying 212 futures contracts on West Texas Intermediate for an astonishing penny each.

Its software couldn’t cope with that pesky minus sign, even though it was always technically possible — though this was an outlandish idea before the pandemic — for the crude market to go upside down. Crude was actually around negative $3.70 a barrel when Shah’s screen had it at 1 cent. Interactive Brokers never displayed a subzero price to him as oil kept diving to end the day at minus $37.63 a barrel.

##Financial markets have got out of whack with the economy. Something has to give

STOCK MARKET HISTORY is packed with drama: the 1929 crash; Black Monday in 1987, when share prices lost 20% in a day; the dotcom mania in 1999. With such precedents, nothing should come as a surprise, but the past eight weeks have been remarkable, nonetheless. A gut-wrenching sell-off in shares has been followed by a delirious rally in America. Between February 19th and March 23rd, the S&amp;P 500 index lost a third of its value. With barely a pause it has since rocketed, recovering more than half its loss. The catalyst was news that the Federal Reserve would buy corporate bonds, helping big firms finance their debts. Investors shifted from panic to optimism without missing a beat.

This rosy view from Wall Street should make you uneasy (see article). It contrasts with markets elsewhere. Shares in Britain and continental Europe, for example, have recovered more sluggishly. And it is a world away from life on Main Street. Even as the lockdown eases in America, the blow to jobs has been savage, with unemployment rising from 4% to about 16%, the highest rate since records began in 1948. While big firms’ shares soar and they get help from the Fed, small businesses are struggling to get cash from Uncle Sam.

Wounds from the financial crisis of 2007-09 are being reopened. “This is the second time we’ve bailed their asses out,” grumbled Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, last month. The battle over who pays for the fiscal burdens of the pandemic is just beginning. On the present trajectory, a backlash against big business is likely.

Start with events in the markets. Much of the improved mood is because of the Fed, which has acted more dramatically than other central banks, buying up assets on an unimagined scale. It is committed to purchasing even more corporate debt, including high-yield “junk” bonds. The market for new issues of corporate bonds, which froze in February, has reopened in spectacular style. Companies have issued $560bn of bonds in the past six weeks, double the normal level. Even beached cruise-line firms have been able to raise cash, albeit at a high price. A cascade of bankruptcies at big firms has been forestalled. The central bank has, in effect, backstopped the cashflow of America Inc. The stockmarket has taken the hint and climbed.

The Fed has little choice—a run on the corporate-bond market would worsen a deep recession. Investors have cheered it on by piling into shares. They have nowhere else good to put their cash. Government-bond yields are barely positive in America. They are negative in Japan and much of Europe. You are guaranteed to lose money by holding them to maturity, and if inflation rises the losses would be painful. So stocks are appealing. By late March prices had fallen by enough to tempt the braver sort. They steeled themselves with the observation that much of the stockmarket’s value is tied to profits that will be made long after the covid-19 slump has given way to recovery.

Tellingly, though, the recent rise in share prices has been uneven. Even before the pandemic the market was lopsided, and it has become more so. Bourses in Britain and continental Europe, chock-full of troubled industries like carmaking, banking and energy, have lagged behind, and there are renewed jitters over the single currency (see article). In America investors have put even more faith in a tiny group of tech darlings—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft—which now make up a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 index. There is little euphoria, just a despairing reach for the handful of businesses judged to be all-weather survivors.

At one level, this makes good sense. Asset managers have to put money to work as best they can. But there is something wrong with how fast stock prices have moved and where they have got back to. American shares are now higher than they were in August. This would seem to imply that commerce and the broader economy can get back to business as usual. There are countless threats to such a prospect, but three stand out.

The first is the risk of an aftershock. It is entirely possible that there will be a second wave of infections. And there are also the consequences of a steep recession to contend with—American GDP is expected to drop by about 10% in the second quarter compared with a year earlier. Many individual bosses hope that ruthless cost-cutting can help protect their margins and pay down the debts accumulated through the furlough. But in aggregate this corporate austerity will depress demand. The likely outcome is a 90% economy, running far below normal levels.

A second hazard to reckon with is fraud. Extended booms tend to encourage shifty behaviour, and the expansion before the covid crash was the longest on record. Years of cheap money and financial engineering mean that accounting shenanigans may now be laid bare. Already there have been two notable scandals in Asia in recent weeks, at Luckin Coffee, a Chinese Starbucks wannabe, and Hin Leong, a Singaporean energy trader that has been hiding giant losses (see article). A big fraud or corporate collapse in America could rock the markets’ confidence, much as the demise of Enron shredded investors’ nerves in 2001 and Lehman Brothers led the stockmarket down in 2008.

The most overlooked risk is of a political backlash. The slump will hurt smaller firms and leave the bigger corporate survivors in a stronger position, increasing the concentration of some industries that was already a problem before the pandemic. A crisis demands sacrifice and will leave behind a big bill. The clamour for payback will only grow louder if big business has hogged more than its share of the subsidies on offer. It is easy to imagine windfall taxes on bailed-out industries, or a sharp reversal of the steady drop in the statutory federal corporate-tax rate, which fell to 21% in 2017 after President Donald Trump’s tax reforms, from a long-term average of well over 30%. Some Democrats want to limit mergers and stop firms returning cash to their owners.

For now, equity investors judge that the Fed has their back. But the mood of the markets can shift suddenly, as an extraordinary couple of months has proved. A one-month bear market scarcely seems enough time to absorb all the possible bad news from the pandemic and the huge uncertainty it has created. This stock market drama has a few more acts yet.■",investing,dangerous gap market real economy economist may edn,pasted article exempt registering account read financial market got whack economy

t3_ggrbf8,Stock market - Where are we? Where will we go?,"Hello everybody, I want to start of by telling you that this is a really long post and I don't expect anyone to take from their personal time to read it. With that being said the structure is at follows - a short summary is the first thing that you will read. You can find the arguments in the body of the post if you are curious. Thank you for your attention.

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary:**

&amp;#x200B;

* Why we won't see a new low in the stock market
* Why will the stock market crash or see a big correction
* How to **not** make a buying decision
* Why covid is not that horrible

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Why we won't see a new low in the stock market**

Will start of by saying that comparing this crisis with 08/09 doesn't work due to the key difference of the core problem. In 08/09 it was a core problem of the financial system, now its a virus. The business were working just fine before covid.

We will not see a new low due to a plethora of reasons. We have the Fed which backstops everything, we have unemployed people getting more money now than when they were working and basing on recent examples we also have a lot of people that can't wait to go out and do stuff. See Disney park in Shanghai being instantly sold out. See Carnival cruises getting booked like crazy and a plethora of other examples where we see people don't care about covid.

The market is driven by the Tech companies right now which we see that are doing really good in this environment.  The slow and steady re-opening will bring business to every other company affected. This is a strong argument for the stock market to go up. Gas will be needed for cars so companies like Exxon, Chevron, Shell will see their demands go higher, pushing the oil price higher and therefore the revenue will be higher.

We will see a bounce back for companies like Realty Income or Simon property Group once people will slowly start to use gyms, go to the malls, getting their jobs back and brining back the normal flow for rent payments.

We will see companies like Verizon or AT&amp;T push higher due to 5G implementation.

We are already seeing healthcare companies going higher and higher based on the situation. A lot of them will start going back down but the big dogs will stay where they are or will push higher.

And so on.. every single industry has strong arguments to go higher and higher by slowly re-opening the country and things normalizing.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Why will the stock market crash or see a big correction**

&amp;#x200B;

Here we need to talk about the elephant in the room, covid. The first and the most obvious reason would be covid doing a spanish flu style rebound and start being a real killer. This is not something that we can debate since its unlikely to happen just because a different disease did this 100 years ago.

Going with more real possibilities, the Fed could be a real reason if they start backing off to soon. I don't expect this to happen but its a possibility and we should take it into account.

The majority of people actually changing spending habits, being fearful of leaving the house or going to work.

The news. Now this one is a big one. If we take a deep dive into audience data for TV news we see that not a lot of people are actually watching them. This is also valid for Twitter, although the margins are a lot tighter. In a theoretical world this would mean that the news are not a huge influence. But they are. Not the TV news. Does are just for ratings. Almost everybody who has a decent chunk of money in the stock market does at least 1% research on their own. Now we expect the data to be bad, that's why we don't see the market going down. But if the data changes and starts coming worse than expected the market will react in accordance. A perfect example is the unemployment news. Right now we all expected it that's why the market didn't go down, but if this situation keeps going and once the country is open the numbers aren't correcting themselves its going to be a huge problem.

Inflation/Deflation numbers can also be a big influence. This is the only topic that I have an understanding for my own but a limited capacity to actually go in depth and explain if for someone else so I will just mention it and leave it here.

China trade war. If Trump cancels the agreement we are going to see a reaction for sure in the market, the only question remaining is how bad?

&amp;#x200B;

**3. How to not make a buying decision**

&amp;#x200B;

Do not base you decision of buying a company, or anything for that matter on what some random persons says on reddit. Never! Even if that person is a super expert and he wants all the good in the world for you, once you buy something that you, personal have no clue about its going to be a source of anxiety because you don't know what happens. Its not worth it.

Do not buy just because FOMO (fear of missing out) - if you do not feel comfortable with the price before you buy, you will definitely not be comfortable after. Just be calm, controlled, do you research, make up your mind about a price, wait for it.

Do your due diligence. No matter the company. You want to buy Apple? Check their balance sheet, check their prospects, look at their future. Ask yourself questions: Will people need this company in 10 years? Will people still buy their products? Can they adapt to new markets? Can they grow their business? Make a list before looking at any company with the things that you care about, note your responses before investigating and then see if its a right fit for you.

&amp;#x200B;

4. **Why covid is not that horrible?**

Ah.. the downvoter topic. I was thinking not tackling this one but, whatever.. my opinion.

I want to start out by looking at Sweden. Do not start comparing the total numbers with the US because that is ridiculous, their population is much smaller.  Start comparing the per million numbers, there things get interesting: Deaths per million: 319 (USA is at 242), Cases per million: 2567 (USA has 4070), test per million: 14704 (USA has 26943). You can see the similarities. They have half the cases but also half the testing power so we can make an educated assumption and put them close to USA.

Sweden measures when comparing with USA are zero. They have very limited measures in place yet the case numbers evolves really similar. This is a case as to why the country should open.

The death rate is 100% overblown. Recent studies in Europe but also in USA start showing that the rate of infection is 20 to 100 higher than the official numbers. Even if we go with the low number of 20, that would put USA cases at over 25 million. This again proves that Covid is not that bad as we expected.

The majority of people that died (over 90%) are people over 65 with underlying conditions. Healthy, young people are just not affected nearly as bad some predicted.

Do not interpret my words on this topic as taking in lightly. I am not. But in a healthy society we need to be able to debate both sides of the story and not only the one pushed in the media.

t3_ggaqva,(Crosspost) Investing in Stocks - Should I buy preferred shares?,"I've got around 10K invested currently in a variety of stocks, but I recently found out about 'preferred shares' and I'm very confused even after an hour of reading up on it...  
For example, I have around $1000 in Enbridge stock (**TSE: ENB**) and it has around a 7.3% estimated dividend yield, whereas some preferred shares of Enbridge have a higher dividend yield (such as **TSE: ENB.PF.E**, which sits at around 9.7% dividend yield currently).

So my main question is, why wouldn't I just sell all my Enbridge shares and buy their preferred shares (like **TSE: ENB.PF.E**) instead?  
Are these higher risk in some way?  
Why do they not go up and down in the same way as the 'real' stock?  
Why do these preferred shares exist? (and why are there so many types?)  
What is the difference between these preferred shares? (like ENB.PF.A vs ENB.PF.E vs ENB.PF.G?)

I'm sorry if I don't know much, I'm only 23 and recently paid off my student loans so I'd like to invest while the market is down but I don't really know what I'm doing...

Here is what my stock portfolio currently looks like (not including the RRSP from my employer, which is around 8K in US Equity):

t3_gg82fe,Is this the sort of situation Options are for?," 

I'm trying to figure out what Options are actually for so I came to realize that a situation I am in might be the purpose behind why Options exist.

So I have money in sort of like a bond that will mature in a couple months and I want to buy a particular stock I think has a good chance of increasing during that time. Is the purpose of buying an option as intended such that I can pay a little bit of money now to buy a Call such that I can buy the stock at a later date closer to its current price rather than the higher price later on.

For instance I would make the expiry after the bond thing matures and I would put the strike price such that the strike price + the fees and cost of the option are lower than what I can expect the stock to be trading at in a couple months.

This seems like the sort of thing Options are intended to be for, but when it is explained it is usually explained in the context of speculating, never when the money you would use to buy is non-liquid. In this situation the Option is a hedge against the increasing value of the stock while the money you would use to buy it is locked away.

The other situation I think Options are working as intended rather than as mere tools of speculation is when companies give stock options to their employees that are discounted as a form of compensation. The reason the Option gives a price that is different than the actual price in this situation is intended precisely because it is meant to encourage the employee to spend some of their money to get a stock which is worth more than they spent and the difference is compensation for them working such that the instant gain they get upon buying the discounted stock is a bit like a paid salary in that they could sell it immediately after buying it for market value.

If we go into more speculation territory buying an option sort of allows you to ""own"" various stocks at various prices without actually spending the money on them such that you could actually own another stock with that money at the same time. If something happens during that time that makes it a good buy for the strike price you could sell the stock you actually own, use the option, and then if you want you could immediately sell the option bought stock at the market value and re-buy the stock you were holding originally, perhaps even buying more of it with the profit you made with the quick sell-hold-stock, buy-call-stock-at-strike-price, sell-call-stock-for-market-value, buy-original-hold-stock. You could even layer this with many more Options than just one such that you could simultaneously ""own"" all the stocks with the same money with the risk being that your call expires before you have a good time to use it. This gives a lot more diversity than an otherwise small amount of money could provide, not to mention that the only risk you take if the price of these stocks drops is you are out the price of the Option rather than the price of the stock, the issue is you have to keep track of all that information, but if an algorithm did this ... well let's just say I now understand that guy who wanted me to make an options trading algorithm back in university that I turned down doing because I didn't understand what the hell was going on.",investing,sort situation option,trying figure option actually came realize situation might purpose behind option exist money sort like bond mature couple month want buy particular stock think good chance increasing time purpose buying option intended pay little bit money buy call buy stock later date closer current price rather higher price later instance would make expiry bond thing matures would put strike price strike price fee cost option lower expect stock trading couple month seems like sort thing option intended explained usually explained context speculating never money would use buy non liquid situation option hedge increasing value stock money would use buy locked away situation think option working intended rather mere tool speculation company give stock option employee discounted form compensation reason option give price different actual price situation intended precisely meant encourage employee spend money get stock worth spent difference compensation working instant gain get upon buying discounted stock bit like paid salary could sell immediately buying market value speculation territory buying option sort allows various stock various price without actually spending money could actually another stock money time something happens time make good buy strike price could sell stock actually use option want could immediately sell option bought stock market value buy stock holding originally perhaps even buying profit made quick sell hold stock buy call stock strike price sell call stock market value buy original hold stock could even layer many option one could simultaneously stock money risk call expires good time use give lot diversity otherwise small amount money could provide mention risk take price stock drop price option rather price stock issue keep track information algorithm well let say understand guy wanted make option trading algorithm back university turned understand hell going,sort situation option trying figure option actually came realize situation might purpose behind option exist money sort like bond mature couple month want buy particular stock think good chance increasing time purpose buying option intended pay little bit money buy call buy stock later date closer current price rather higher price later instance would make expiry bond thing matures would put strike price strike price fee cost option lower expect stock trading couple month seems like sort thing option intended explained usually explained context speculating never money would use buy non liquid situation option hedge increasing value stock money would use buy locked away situation think option working intended rather mere tool speculation company give stock option employee discounted form compensation reason option give price different actual price situation intended precisely meant encourage employee spend money get stock worth spent difference compensation working instant gain get upon buying discounted stock bit like paid salary could sell immediately buying market value speculation territory buying option sort allows various stock various price without actually spending money could actually another stock money time something happens time make good buy strike price could sell stock actually use option want could immediately sell option bought stock market value buy stock holding originally perhaps even buying profit made quick sell hold stock buy call stock strike price sell call stock market value buy original hold stock could even layer many option one could simultaneously stock money risk call expires good time use give lot diversity otherwise small amount money could provide mention risk take price stock drop price option rather price stock issue keep track information algorithm well let say understand guy wanted make option trading algorithm back university turned understand hell going
t3_gg4lbj,How does Blackrock have such a long arm?,"Looking at Blackrocks almost 100 billion dollar valuation is far from the depth their company has in the financial world. They can manage to control around 7 **trillion** worth of assets as well as almost 3 times that amount worth of insight through their enterprise software. Blackrock Solutions has insight on the very data it can invest in. Is this not some sort of breach?

This question has been bugging me for years now and I do understand the reason they can be auditors, advisors, and investors all at once. Financial markets are extremely complex and Blackrock has the resources and abilities to tackle financial issues governments and companies have. I understand why they are chosen to fix those issues. But how are they allowed to act in all those roles that overlap?

I do understand the heads of Blackrock are also the founders and they genuinely seem to have a positive interest in society as they are willing to shift and adapt their investment and other business to a more progressive time - think how Dicks and other stores stopped selling guns. This was due to Blackrocks ability to shift market sentiment based on their philosophies. No issues with their philosophies (above was only one example) - but what happens when Blackrock finds itself under new ownership with different views? Would this not completely shift the paradigm of the current financial world?

&amp;#x200B;

This is not to say they are untrustworthy, misguided, or are unable to pick successors. It just feels astonishing to see a company with such a far reach, especially in comparison to Vanguard, Schwab, State Street, or whoever.

Given all the economic news, I feel like we're at the ""Printing Money &amp; Credit"" stage and we've been here for quite some time. The virus just dialed it up to 11.

My question: even with a strong recovery around second half of 2020, is an economic downturn (and the eventual downward pressure on the stock market) inevitable given the stage we are currently in? A good number of people have mentioned that corporate debt and commercial mortgages are the next big things that'll come home to roost. To me, it kinda makes sense and I wonder if Covid recovery can really stop these forces and sustainably push the markets to new all-time highs in 2020 - especially with the Fed freshly out of interest rate cuts and printing money like a Charmin' factory doing a mountain of cocaine.

For the bulls and bears, what is your upside and downside thesis?  As you can tell, I'm a bit bearish at the moment and as such, am more curious about the bull thesis, just in case I have a substantial blindspot that's unbeknownst to me.

t3_gfweu3,"Using data going back to 1971, I graphed the the ""average year"" for the stock market.","[Average Year](https://imgur.com/6a8bTkD.png)

The above picture is the graph of what the average year looks like for the Dow Jones Industrial Average over the span of Jan 1971 - Present. [It was inspired by this (now removed) post from yesterday.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/gfg0g2/what_does_the_average_year_of_the_stock_market/)

On the horizontal axis, the days of the year are numbered, so 1 = Jan 1st, 2= Jan 2nd, and so on...

**How did I produce this?**

I used the daily closing values for the Dow listed on [this website](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/index/DJIA/historical-prices). This was the most thorough stock market history I could find on short notice. Let me know if there is a better data set I can use!

I wrote a quick and dirty Python script to calculate the percentage change over every day ranging from 1971 until now and take the geometric mean of those changes for each day of the year, ranging from Jan 1 to Dec 31.

I then put all of those cumulatively together to graph the above.

**What about weekends and holidays?**

The trickiest part conceptually may have been how to interpolate the data to account for weekends and other market closures, since those do not come on regular dates. Since I was using closing values, what I ended up doing for a typical weekend was just geometrically averaging the change from Friday close to Monday close over Saturday, Sunday, and Monday.

---

For example, let's say we have the following closing values:

Thurs: 9000
Fri: 9100
Mon: 9300

Then I would calculate the change for Friday to be: 9100/9000 = 1.01111
And I would calculate the change for Sat, Sun, and Mon to be (9300/9100)^1/3 = 1.00727

So the list of changes would look like:

Fri: 1.01111

Sat: 1.00727

Sun: 1.00727

Mon: 1.00727

---

It's not ideal, and can probably cause some artifacts, but it shouldn't matter too much when averaging over a lot of dates.

**Other Graphs:**

I also constructed similar graphs using [arithmetic mean of daily changes](https://imgur.com/dzHFwgt.png) and the [median of daily changes](https://imgur.com/McTs0sT.png).

The arithmetic mean graph is very similar to the geometric mean graph, but is a bit more extreme. This isn't too surprising.

The median graph is much more balanced, which also makes sense. It seems that the most dramatic effects of the first graph are caused by a relatively small number of extreme years.

It would also be really easy to adapt my code to work with a different time span or index. I would just need the data. It might be interesting to compare the average annual performance of different sectors or market caps.

t3_gfnavf,Perhaps the most relevant excerpt from one of Ray Dalio's book,"""In the early stages of a bubble bursting, when stock prices fall and earnings have not yet declined, people mistakenly judge the decline to be a buying opportunity and find stocks cheap in relation to both past earnings and expected earnings, failing to account for the amount of decline in earnings that is likely to result from what’s to come. But the reversal is self-reinforcing. As wealth falls first and incomes fall later, creditworthiness worsens, which constricts lending activity, which hurts spending and lowers investment rates while also making it less appealing to borrow to buy financial assets. This in turn worsens the fundamentals of the asset (e.g., the weaker economic activity leads corporate earnings to chronically disappoint), leading people to sell and driving down prices further. This has an accelerating downward impact on asset prices, income, and wealth.""

t3_gfoii9,There might be a logical reason to why the markets keep going up,"Many people seem perplexed about this fact. Bad news should mean that the market should go down. Problem is, bad news means more action from the state/fed. One action is as we all know 0% interest rates. What return do you need to make a profit with 0% interest rates? Anything above 0.

This means that if you can borrow money at 0% and expect a return of 0,000001% you are making a profit. The Fed saying that they will do everything to get full emplyment back means that some investors see the doom and gloom headlines as a confirmation that the Fed will keep rates low. This signals that it's worth borrowing money to put into the market, because any return above 0 is worth it. 

The only question is how long this will last. My guess is when positive news starts taking the overhand, investors will scale back their risk. Simply because the 0% interest rate and state action is less likely to last as long the more positive the sentiment gets on the economy. Sentiment will be more positive in the news and stocks will be going down. People will say that it's rigged - but it's not. It's just how the markets work, even if you hate it.

At least this is how I interpret the current situation and I am short on the market. Unless Fed and State turns positive in their sentiment, my investment is pretty much screwed. But I'm aware of this and I could of course be wrong.

t3_gfvwq5,New York City CMBS Delinquencies Rise on $7 Billion of Loans,"By Natalie Wong

(Bloomberg) -- New York City’s shutdown is pressuring loans
tied to commercial real estate, with retail and hotels hit the
hardest.
April payments were late on about $7 billion of commercial
mortgage-backed securities debt backed by properties in the
city, more than double the amount a year earlier, according to
data firm Trepp.
About $740 million of those loans are considered
delinquent, meaning at least 30 days behind. Retail and lodging
debt, the sectors with the highest percentage of delinquencies,
accounted for 41% and 19% of the total.
Stay-at-home orders have crushed business at stores,
restaurants and hotels in New York, the center of the
coronavirus pandemic in the U.S. Owners of these properties --
including hotels in Times Square and shops on Fifth Avenue --
are struggling to pay mortgages as their rent collections fall.
The rate of delinquencies could grow if borrowers continue
to skip payments in May, which is likely given the shutdown’s
impact on the economy.
Some landlords are working out payment arrangements with
their lenders, but options are limited. Special servicers, firms
assigned to handle vulnerable CMBS loans on behalf of
bondholders, are too short-staffed to manage the sudden surge of
defaults and modification requests, said Justin Piasecki, a
principal at brokerage Avison Young.

t3_gf16kn,"A wave of bankruptcies, surging taxes, and Americans harboring lasting scars from coronavirus lockdowns — the head of world’s largest asset manager warns of grim outlook","BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink had a stark message for a private audience: As bad as things have been for corporate America in recent weeks, they’re likely to get worse.

Mass bankruptcies, empty planes, cautious consumers and an increase in the corporate tax rate to as high as 29% were part of a vision Fink sketched out on a call this week. The message from the leader of the world’s biggest asset manager contrasts with the ebullient tones of a stock market that has snapped back from recent lows.


Even among Wall Street luminaries, Fink speaks with particular clout. He has been advising President Donald Trump on how to navigate the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. And BlackRock is playing a key role in the Federal Reserve’s efforts to stabilize markets, helping the central bank buy billions of dollars in assets.

Fink said on the call with clients of a wealth advisory firm that bankers have told him they expect a cascade of bankruptcies to hit the American economy, and he wondered if the Fed needed to do more to provide support, according to a person with knowledge of the remarks.

A BlackRock spokesman declined to comment.

Even as the U.S. is plunged into deepening economic gloom, it will have to raise taxes to pay for emergency efforts to rescue sectors grappling with a difficult recovery, he warned on the call.

Among his predictions: lifting the 21% corporate rate signed into law as part of 2017’s tax overhaul to about 28% or 29% next year, according to the person. Fink also said he sees tax rates for individuals going up.

​Raising taxes would water down the biggest legislative achievement of Trump’s time in office, when he and a Republican-controlled Congress drove through the most significant changes to the tax code in decades.

Lower corporate rates juiced profits and showered cash on shareholders through increased dividends and stock buybacks. Now, at a time when many taxpayers are less able to bear the burden of higher taxes, the government may be forced to extract a larger share of companies’ and individuals’ income.

The spread of the coronavirus, and measures taken to mitigate it, slammed the brakes on the economy. While Trump pushes to reopen commerce and his officials predict a rapid rebound, public health experts and some economists are skeptical the crisis will soon be over.

Politicians, business leaders and economists are beginning to confront the risks of a limited federal response that might speed up the demise of smaller companies and wreck state and municipal finances that pay for schools, law enforcement and infrastructure.

That won’t be the only strain on companies. Many may have to operate with only about half their staff in the office for more than a year, according to Fink. Across white-collar industries, millions are working remotely from home. It would be hard to see a complete return without mass availability of rapid testing, he said.

There’s a risk that the U.S. outbreak will be severe enough to leave a long-lasting impact on the American psyche, undermining Americans’ willingness to take public transport or fly, according to Fink. He said he’s not aware of any of his CEO peers planning international travel this year.

Underscoring the point, this week home-sharing leader Airbnb Inc. and ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies Inc. announced plans for mass layoffs as they wrestle with falling demand and dimmed prospects for the rest of the year.

Many of the U.S.’s 30 million small businesses have struggled to get the relief they need. If the crisis continues, about 25% of those companies could close permanently before year-end, according to an April report released by Main Street America, a network comprising approximately 300,000 small businesses.

Restaurants that typically operate with thin margins will struggle to survive as they plot out ways to lure back customers with social-distancing measures in place, Fink said.

Fink also said he was concerned the worsening economic duress could further fan the flames of nationalism. The devastating impact from the coronavirus could make it a bigger threat to the global order, he said.

t3_gfthws,401(k) IRA theory question,"  

Kinda have a theory and I want to tap your thoughts. With the number of people unemployed many are currently collecting unemployment benefits. of course out of the 30 million unemployed maybe half or three quarters actually have a retirement savings plan and or health savings account. Once that runs out, people are going to start tapping into their IRA/s 401ks and other retirement savings to live on pay bills, rent, mortgage, and make ends meet. Once people start accessing their retirement savings in numbers, many funds will have to liquidate their holdings. Fund will have not choice but to liquidate parts of their holdings. With the outflow of capital this may create a domino effect in which people with regular investment accounts will start to sell. This may weigh heavily on stocks. I'm not sure whether such an event will have a big impact on the stock market. I’m just weighing the possibilities.

t3_gg7k9d,The problems with tech stocks,"OK. I am a bear for now simply because the economy is in the toilet and won't be back for a while (think 3 years). The S&amp;P 500 is down 13.7% from all time highs and the NASDAQ is down 9.27%--not even a ""correction"" anymore. There is no way that a bear market lasts 23 trading days when companies are laying off workers by the tens of millions in a country with 165 million working people, in addition to oil companies and retailers going bankrupt left and right.

The problem, of course, is that Facebook, Amazon and Google don't pay a dividend. Meanwhile, Microsoft and Apple pay a meagre 1.x % dividend. Why is this important? Retirees have the most money and are most likely to influence the markets with their money, not some random 25 year olds just starting out.

Retirees need a regular source of income, and dividends are one way to get it. Yes, you see the stocks go up, but in order for you to get money out of it, you have to sell. When you sell, that part of your money is no longer participating in the stock market.

So, if you want income and stay in the market, you need something that has reasonable dividends (3-5%) and have enough profits to be able to afford paying them for the long term. You don't want high yield (10-15%) because these are probably going bust or their dividends are going to get cut soon (especially if the high yield is the result of the stock plunging 75% due to problems with the company).

Oh, by the way, debt is exploding at a terrifying speed (think of all kinds of fiscal stimulus paid by all countries to their residents, citizens and corporations). Oh and what about household debt that has been built up post-2008? The US fiscal stimulus can't last more than a few months and when everything reopens, there will be too many people chasing too few jobs, putting downward pressure on wages. Exploding debt + collapsing economic activity = very very slow growth going forward (You complained about how US GDP growth sucked post-GFC? Think about how much lower growth will be post-COVID!) Lower growth potential means lower P/E ratios, which basically means substantially lower prices for stocks in the face of collapsing future earnings.

If the stock market is right, and that 100X P/E for Amazon is justified, then eventually, Walmart, Target, Costco, etc... will all go out of business and the market share will get eaten by Amazon. If that kind of consolidation is actually to happen, we will see the end of capitalism because competition will no longer exist. Prices will rise to whatever the market will bear, and holders of specific assets (namely stocks of Amazon or similar monopolies) will be quadrillionaires while the rest of the world will be incapable of saving money due to, for instance, a loaf of bread that normally costs $2 becomes $20. Money will become pointless other than for the purposes of the masses enriching the 0.01%. The days of a frugal person living on $10 000 a year on a $50 000 salary will be over as that hypothetical person's spending becomes $30 000 and basically can't save anything after taxes. Standard of living for the masses in rich countries will drop to third-world levels while third world residents will starve like they do in Venezuela.

Further to that, if someone who is single, childless and makes $50 000 can barely survive, and there are about 50% of people who make less than that. This will mean that the masses will stop having kids and when they get old, population aging will cause governments to go bust because of healthcare costs--not to mention that pensions cannot survive in negative interest rate environments that last for decades. Soverign defaults will sweep the globe and that is how humanity ends.

This is a rant about how, taken to the logical extreme of what message the stock market is trying to send, is anything but good. The stock market is trying to say that, because of reduced competition, prices will soar, and as a result, the middle class craters into abject poverty and the world becomes less and less sustainable

t3_gg0vtt,Why High Unemployment Doesn't Mean Stocks Should Fall,"* In the U.S., at least, a huge percentage of corporate earnings come from tech companies that generate huge profits from relatively few employees
* As an example of the above, consider Facebook, which earned $18 billion last year with 44,000 employees, and contrast it with GM, which earned about $6 billion with 164,000 employees
* This makes employment less relevant to corporate earnings than it was in the past (not to say there's not still a correlation)
* Not only that, but these tech companies have more flexibility to offer Work-From-Home arrangements than other companies do
* So their productivity needn't take a hit during this particular recession; advertising revenue will decline but not to a crippling degree
* Additionally, a good few of these tech companies have almost no debt. No debt means no interest expense, which makes it easier to turn profits even with revenue down.
* Some recent earnings reports bear this out, such as Facebook's 100% year-over-year growth in EPS, Amazon's 26% revenue growth, etc.
* Conclusion: publicly traded U.S. stocks as a class, particularly NASDAQ-listed ones, aren't necessarily seeing their fundamentals being hit that hard when you consider what a large percentage of their composition by market cap is tech stocks.
* Disclaimer: this analysis only applies to U.S. markets, I'm not aware of any other countries whose equity markets have such a heavy weighting in tech stocks.",investing,high unemployment mean stock fall, least huge percentage corporate earnings come tech company generate huge profit relatively employee example consider facebook earned billion last year employee contrast earned billion employee make employment relevant corporate earnings past say still correlation tech company flexibility offer work home arrangement company productivity take hit particular recession advertising revenue decline crippling degree additionally good tech company almost debt debt mean interest expense make easier turn profit even revenue recent earnings report bear facebook year year growth eps amazon revenue growth etc conclusion publicly traded stock class particularly nasdaq listed one necessarily seeing fundamental hit hard consider large percentage composition market cap tech stock disclaimer analysis applies market aware country whose equity market heavy weighting tech stock,high unemployment mean stock fall  least huge percentage corporate earnings come tech company generate huge profit relatively employee example consider facebook earned billion last year employee contrast earned billion employee make employment relevant corporate earnings past say still correlation tech company flexibility offer work home arrangement company productivity take hit particular recession advertising revenue decline crippling degree additionally good tech company almost debt debt mean interest expense make easier turn profit even revenue recent earnings report bear facebook year year growth eps amazon revenue growth etc conclusion publicly traded stock class particularly nasdaq listed one necessarily seeing fundamental hit hard consider large percentage composition market cap tech stock disclaimer analysis applies market aware country whose equity market heavy weighting tech stock

t3_gfsn42,Leaps vs stocks ?,"Why are leaps not considered a great option to invest long term? 
In context: 
So many companies are undervalued but personally  for me it’s impossible to buy a 100 shares of them outright right now. Instead buying a leap a 1 year out would give me enough time to save up for them and also have the company grow back in value. For ex:
A big bank like Bank of America is trading at around 23$, a hundred shares of which would cost me 2300$.  Why not just buy the atm 25$ call for 2.27 and break even of 27.27$ per share(expiring Jan 2021)? 
These stocks are bound to recover as they provide the backbone for the economy (to an extent). So then going to even half of the value they were last year(~35ish) isn’t impossible.

t3_gfjlre,Can someone help me better understand dividend investing?,"I like the idea of dividend investing but I feel there are many arguments on BOTH sides. I'd like to present a few and discuss them.

&amp;#x200B;

**1) Dividend stocks aren't good because they just remove from the stock price.**

So that's true. I don't think dividend stocks are good for growth. I think it is a great capital preservation if the company is solid like $T. They are the same price as they were four years ago and it is an excellent way to accumulate shares.

**My question:** Is this more of a wealth preservation option? What about growth dividends? I'd say AAPL and SBUX are examples of this (although I think AAPL is starting to mature as a company, but that is a different problem set on its own).

**2) If they don't grow, why bother?**

I'm not sure what to say about this. Hence the reach out for opinions. I feel that while they don't excel as much as growth stocks, they do grow faster than bonds. A safe bet, IMO. Of course, assuming it is a diversified spread like SPHD which I own a small portion of.

**My question:** Can someone give opinions of good growth dividend stocks that I have not mentioned already? Secondly, can someone help me rationalize point two, where it gives a purpose for dividend investing?

**3) DRIP or no?**

I have a question on this  one. Why not DRIP? If not drip, I guess you can  use the dividend to invest in something else. However, I want to drip so that my dividend stocks accumulate faster. Catch22?

**My question:** I only gave an example of why DRIP is good or not good. Can someone give an argument for both sides?

**4) When to buy?**

I think it is best to buy dividend stocks during a recession. I say this for three good reasons. The first reason is to **accumulate as many shares as possible.** You can not only buy cheap shares at times of recession, you also accumulate shares with dividends. It is a win win if you ask me. My next reason is that I don't really have to worry about selling out. Finally, with dividends, I do have a **cash flow coming in** if I needed it (hopefully not relying on dividend income though lmao). Getting a few low thousand a months through dividends is not that far off or unattainable IMO?

With a grain of salt though, because companies cancel their dividend like Disney and Ford. Fair enough, but that's why I try to mitigate that risk by avoiding individual companies or selecting individual companies with historical dividends (Look up dividend aristocrats). Companies like KO etc. Of course if KO stops giving dividends, then we are in bigger trouble than we realize and cash would be a better alternative.

**My question:** I say the best time is to buy Dividend stocks during recessions. Why? Best way to accumulate shares. Can someone puncture my argument? Secondly, What dividend strategy do you use (loaded question, would appreciate it though)?

**5) Placement**

This one is easy, put it in your tax advantaged accounts. My question is, is there a good position or opportunity in a taxable account? I would put it in a taxable account if I needed to withdraw the dividend income (not DRIP). Unfortunately I live in California so I am dicked.

**My question:** Can anyone think of a scenario/strategy where taxation would be mitigated or even somewhat effective? More specifically and in addition to, when/how would you put in a taxable account? Please don't say when you  have no additional room in your tax-advantaged. That is assumed in this question.

t3_geu5e2,What Buffett actually said about Berkshire's Cash Position,"Getting tired of reading posts from people who clearly didn't watch or read this earnings report or probably any earnings report so here we go. Tldr: His cash position (actually t-bills) is not large compared to the entirety of Berk's assets. Now can you all stop with the ""But Buffett's holding cash"" meme?

""I show our net, our cash and Treasury bill position on March 31st. And you might look at that and say, “Well, you’ve got $125 billion or so in cash and Treasury bills. And you’ve got…” At least at that point, we had about, I don’t know, $180 billion or so in equities. And you can say, “Well, that’s a huge position to have in Treasury bills versus just $180 billion in equities.”
 
But we really have far more than that in equities because we own a lot of businesses. We own 100% of the stock of a great many businesses, which to us are very similar to the marketable stocks we own. We just don’t own them all. They don’t have a quote on them. But we have hundreds of billions of wholly owned businesses. So our $124 billion is not some 40% or so cash positions, it’s far less than that. 

And we will always keep plenty of cash on hand, and for any circumstances, with a 9/11 comes along, if the stock market is closed, as it was in World War I—it’s not going to be, but I didn’t think we were going to be having a pandemic when I watched that Creighton-Villanova game in January either.""

**Notes:** This portfolio is based of off Paul Merimimans 'BEST-IN-CLASS TAX-DEFERRED ULTIMATE ALL-VALUE ETF' portfolio. I chose this portfolio because I liked how aggressive it was and centered around All Value ETF's. The only thing I didn't like was how high the expense ratios were. I also understand that Value Equities have not performed well the last 10 years or so but historically they have outperformed growth stocks.  


I know I am going to get a lot of flack for this because I am not using the standard 3-fund portfolio but this portfolio made sense to me. It is currently not doing so well and down 18% in total. Current Value: $14,430. I know some of this has to do with the market volatility due to Covid19 but it was not performing well at all before that either.  


**Final Thoughts/Questions:**  


Is this something I should just ride out, stomach the losses right now, and keep maxing out my Roth IRA every year into these funds because Value Equities have performed very well historically?  


Or is this something I really need to be concerned about due to the high expense ratios and how poorly Value Equities have performed the last decade?  


These loses are hard to stomach at the moment but if I am going by history things will work out. I really don't want to sell out of these funds (Especially since I am at a loss right now) but considering this is my retirement, I am willing to do whatever is necessary.  


I truly would love any feedback or thoughts about my current portfolio and wether I should continue moving forward with it or move in a different direction.

t3_gf3cfc,Housing A Risky Investment?,"I know this is outside the purview of options bullshit but it’s an investment that is frequently leveraged up the ass.  3% down and you get 100% of the profit or loss, with favorable margin rates.

Here’s my theory:

A significant component in the rise of housing prices since the 1980s is due to declining interest rates.  The supply is constrained so it’s responsive to the ability of buyers to outbid each other.  Americans are used to the idea of spending 30% or whatever of their household income on their mortgage payment, maybe more.  If interest rates drop but real wages stay the same and the percentage of money spent on housing stays the same, then the principal has to increase.  Which means housing prices go up.

But now we’re pretty much touching against risk adjusted 0% interest rates.  If it was any cheaper the bank might as well be paying you.  The interest rate cannot keep dropping in order to fuel more housing price increase.  So there’s not really any more room for housing prices to boost off low interest rates.  There’s probably still time until they adjust to current rates and an increase when the economy eventually picks up again, but the growth seen over the past three decades is coming to an end.

Also, there’s significant risk if inflation picks up.  If housing and wages both rise in pace with inflation their ratio stays the same, but interest rates will also climb.  This means that buyers must now commit a larger portion of their gross income to P&amp;I payments.  If lenders won’t allow them to do that then the only way to accommodate increased i is by lowering p.  Which means housing has to lose value if that happens.",investing,housing risky investment,know outside purview option bullshit investment frequently leveraged get profit loss favorable margin rate theory significant component rise housing price since due declining interest rate supply constrained responsive ability buyer outbid american used idea spending whatever household income mortgage payment maybe interest rate drop real wage stay percentage money spent housing stay principal increase mean housing price pretty much touching risk adjusted interest rate cheaper bank might well paying interest rate cannot keep dropping order fuel housing price increase really room housing price boost low interest rate probably still time adjust current rate increase economy eventually pick growth seen past three decade coming end also significant risk inflation pick housing wage rise pace inflation ratio stay interest rate also climb mean buyer must commit larger portion gross income payment lender allow way accommodate increased lowering mean housing lose value happens,housing risky investment know outside purview option bullshit investment frequently leveraged get profit loss favorable margin rate theory significant component rise housing price since due declining interest rate supply constrained responsive ability buyer outbid american used idea spending whatever household income mortgage payment maybe interest rate drop real wage stay percentage money spent housing stay principal increase mean housing price pretty much touching risk adjusted interest rate cheaper bank might well paying interest rate cannot keep dropping order fuel housing price increase really room housing price boost low interest rate probably still time adjust current rate increase economy eventually pick growth seen past three decade coming end also significant risk inflation pick housing wage rise pace inflation ratio stay interest rate also climb mean buyer must commit larger portion gross income payment lender allow way accommodate increased lowering mean housing lose value happens

t3_get1nm,$RSI - Rogers Sugar - good TSX-listed yield play,"I've been keeping an eye on and recently bought TSX:RSI. It's currently trading at a 7.5%+ yield and is still trading about 25% off pre-COVID highs. \~$95mm EBITDA business with $5-$10mm of maintenance capex. Brokers are shitting on it because they didn't hit Q2 estimates (+25% EBITDA growth, whereas they were flat), but given the climate we're in - and yield it's trading at - IDGAF.

**Some thoughts on why I like it:**

* **Stable volume.** Yes, per capita sugar consumption is declining, but with NA population growth, it's stable to moderately growing. And with everything going on in the world, the fact that volumes have not been impacted is positive.
* **Limited price risk.** Sugar is a transparent, liquid market. RSI matches future sales to purchases, so it doesn't take commodity risk. It basically earns a dollar margin per lb.
* **Stable free cash flow.** Given the above, FCF is quite stable. Maintenance capex is relatively small. The company is a bit of a NWC pig, but given low volume/price risk above it's been manageable.
* **Low risk to distribution.** Given stable FCF and $100mm of borrowing room, distributions don't appear to be at risk. Payout ratios are high (biggest knock on RSI), but in a flat market and modest capital needs, what else are would they do with that cash.
* **Free option on Maple Syrup.** RSI acquired one of the largest maple syrup producers in 2017, which has been an absolute dog. But that capital has been spent, and so I view earnings to be somewhat trough-y.
* **Installed capacity.** I've been looking for businesses with good installed capacity in this market. Companies with solid PP&amp;E that have some nameplate capacity and earnings power. I like them because negative operating leverage is hitting earnings hard, but you should get torque on the way out of COVID. RSI isn't experiencing this, but it's good downside protection.
* **Duopoly producer.** One of two sugar producers in Canada, and no one is investing in processing capacity any time soon given growth trends.
* **Structural market benefits.** USA sugar market is a protected market with high import tariffs that can mean prices that are 2x Canadian prices. Food producers can manufacture in Canada with cheap sugar, and then import finished products into America without tariffs; drives steady demand.

**This one isn't without its hair:**

* **Future volume.** While it's positive that volumes were strong in Q2 2020, that might reflect contracts they sold well before COVID. That said, their product is going into shelf-stable products and confectionary, which are experiencing record-high demand.
* **Supply chain.** If RSI can't get their hands on raw materials because international supply chains are clogged up, then that would be a big deal. It looks like they have about 3 mos of inventory on hand.
* **Payout ratio.** It does have a high payout ratio and you can sensibly argue it's risky. I don't see it, but I understand the argument.
* **Leverage.** Aside from 4.0x debt, the capital structure is stinky. A bunch of convertible debt outstanding (5%, converts at $8.00+) which might preclude the Company taking on additional debt and issuing additional equity - distributions would be first to go.
* **Insider governance.** Finally, the governance structure is a bit of a mess that I think might ward off interested acquirers in considering a takeover.",investing,rsi rogers sugar good tsx listed yield play,keeping eye recently bought tsx rsi currently trading yield still trading pre covid high ebitda business maintenance capex broker shitting hit estimate ebitda growth whereas flat given climate yield trading idgaf thought like stable volume yes per caput sugar consumption declining population growth stable moderately growing everything going world fact volume impacted positive limited price risk sugar transparent liquid market rsi match future sale purchase take commodity risk basically earns dollar margin per stable free cash flow given fcf quite stable maintenance capex relatively small company bit nwc pig given low volume price risk manageable low risk distribution given stable fcf borrowing room distribution appear risk payout ratio high biggest knock rsi flat market modest capital need else would cash free option maple syrup rsi acquired one largest maple syrup producer absolute dog capital spent view earnings somewhat trough installed capacity looking business good installed capacity market company solid nameplate capacity earnings power like negative operating leverage hitting earnings hard get torque way covid rsi experiencing good downside protection duopoly producer one two sugar producer canada one investing processing capacity time soon given growth trend structural market benefit usa sugar market protected market high import tariff mean price canadian price food producer manufacture canada cheap sugar import finished product america without tariff drive steady demand one without hair future volume positive volume strong might reflect contract sold well covid said product going shelf stable product confectionary experiencing record high demand supply chain rsi get hand raw material international supply chain clogged would big deal look like inventory hand payout ratio high payout ratio sensibly argue risky see understand argument leverage aside debt capital structure stinky bunch convertible debt outstanding convert might preclude company taking additional debt issuing additional equity distribution would first insider governance finally governance structure bit mess think might ward interested acquirer considering takeover,rsi rogers sugar good tsx listed yield play keeping eye recently bought tsx rsi currently trading yield still trading pre covid high ebitda business maintenance capex broker shitting hit estimate ebitda growth whereas flat given climate yield trading idgaf thought like stable volume yes per caput sugar consumption declining population growth stable moderately growing everything going world fact volume impacted positive limited price risk sugar transparent liquid market rsi match future sale purchase take commodity risk basically earns dollar margin per stable free cash flow given fcf quite stable maintenance capex relatively small company bit nwc pig given low volume price risk manageable low risk distribution given stable fcf borrowing room distribution appear risk payout ratio high biggest knock rsi flat market modest capital need else would cash free option maple syrup rsi acquired one largest maple syrup producer absolute dog capital spent view earnings somewhat trough installed capacity looking business good installed capacity market company solid nameplate capacity earnings power like negative operating leverage hitting earnings hard get torque way covid rsi experiencing good downside protection duopoly producer one two sugar producer canada one investing processing capacity time soon given growth trend structural market benefit usa sugar market protected market high import tariff mean price canadian price food producer manufacture canada cheap sugar import finished product america without tariff drive steady demand one without hair future volume positive volume strong might reflect contract sold well covid said product going shelf stable product confectionary experiencing record high demand supply chain rsi get hand raw material international supply chain clogged would big deal look like inventory hand payout ratio high payout ratio sensibly argue risky see understand argument leverage aside debt capital structure stinky bunch convertible debt outstanding convert might preclude company taking additional debt issuing additional equity distribution would first insider governance finally governance structure bit mess think might ward interested acquirer considering takeover

t3_gf19hz,"If small cap growth stocks are so bad, why has VBK outperformed?","Small cap growth stocks seem to be the black sheep of the investing world, especially to firms like AQR and DFA.

Small cap growth stocks have been accused of dragging down the effects of the size premium with their historical low returns, high volatility and frequent delistings.

Why then has Vanguard’s small cap growth ETF, VBK, has such good performance over the last 15 years, beating out both the S&amp;P 500 and Vanguard’s small cap value ETF, VBR, which would be supposed to deliver better long term returns according to the Fama-French five factor model. 

What conditions, if any, in the US caused this anomaly, or is this just the case of the factor premiums being negative over a given timeframe, as they sometimes are? Is the Fama-French model dead?

A shockwave created causing stocks like INO, BSGM, NVAX, to drop substainally.

&gt;For example, the NCFC's Insider Trading and Fraud Surveillance teams recently identified suspected COVID-19 fraud activity at select firms. This regulatory intelligence was shared with NCFC's AML and Cause Exam teams as well as with FINRA's Enforcement Department which, collectively, reviewed the information and opened exams and investigations. The investigations are active and ongoing.  
&gt;  
&gt;The NCFC, at the heart of the Task Force, is on the front lines of surveillance, investigations and examinations for pandemic-related fraud. Since early February, NCFC has been investigating and referring dozens of potential fraud scenarios involving public companies to the SEC. To date, the Fraud Surveillance group within NCFC has sent 50 referrals to the SEC involving public companies making potentially fraudulent COVID-19 claims. These referrals have provided direct assistance to the **SEC in suspending trading in the shares of more than 20 public companies.**

My beef with Boeing's business model is that they have some really bad executives running the company into the ground long term. Boeing executives are the prototypical corporate dickhead Chad-types, who only look for short term gain at all cost. They are really the caricature of greed and privilege. Boeing spent considerable amount of their capital buying back stocks and executive comps, which inherently has 0 value to the company's business success. Management's comp tied to stock performance is great for stockholders, but that has not materialized for me yet. Most recently, Boeing refused government bailout money and opted to be beholden to private banks because taking government money would mean the CEO and his buddies would not be able to fire employees, continue stock buybacks in the future, and do all the things required of a conscientious, socially responsible corporation.

t3_gekay7,Shopify Recent #'s + Mercadolibre +23% after earnings,"E-commerce doing well - Shopify with some interesting stats (see bolded) and Mercadolibre, too.

SHOP:

**New stores created on the Shopify platform grew 62% between March 13, 2020 and April 24, 2020 compared
to the prior six weeks**, driven by the shift of commerce to online as well as by the extension of the free trial
period on standard plans from 14 days to 90 days. While this increase includes both first-time entrepreneurs
as well as established sellers, it is unclear how many in this cohort will sustainably generate sales, which is
the primary determinant of merchant longevity on our platform. New store creations represents merchants
who have provided billing information, which also allows them to start selling.


While year-over-year Gross Merchandise (""GMV"") growth accelerated in April compared with the
first quarter of 2020, and this growth was distributed over a broader base of merchants, it is unclear how
sustainable consumer spending levels will be in this uncertain economic environment. For now, the shift of
consumer spending toward online is apparent: the number of consumers estimated to have made a purchase
for the first time from any Shopify merchant grew 8% between March 13, 2020 and April 24, 2020, compared
to the six-week period immediately prior. Over the same period, the number of consumers estimated to have
purchased from Shopify merchants they’d never shopped at before grew by 45% compared to the six-week
period immediately prior.

**While GMV through the point-of-sale (POS) channel declined by 71% between March 13, 2020 and April 24,
2020 relative to the comparable six-week period immediately prior to March 13, as most of Shopify’s Retail
merchants suspended their in-store operations, *Retail merchants managed to replace 94% of lost POS GMV
with online sales over the same period*.** Retail merchants are adapting quickly to social-distance selling, as
26% of our brick-and-mortar merchants in our English-speaking geographies are now using some form of
local in-store/curbside pickup and delivery solution, compared to 2% at the end of February.

While new types of merchants, such as food stores, are migrating to Shopify Plus, March and April also saw
more merchants downgrade from Shopify Plus to lower-priced plans than in January and February.

Certain categories of GMVgrew faster between March 13, 2020 and April 24, 2020, including Food, Beverages,
and Tobacco, which doubled during this period relative to the 6-weeks immediately prior to March 13. Apparel
and accessories, a historically larger contributor to Shopify's GMV, experienced a softening in GMV in midMarch, followed by a recovery at the end of March, which continued into April. 

Mercadolibre:

The marketplace KPI’s hit a low point during the week of the 18th to the 24th of March. **Yearover-year growth for items sold during that week troughed at 3.3%, with Fx Neutral GMV

t3_geovzg,Lazy portfolio for Eurozone,"Most typical three-/four-fund portfolio examples I've seen are constructed from a U.S. perspective. I'm based in Germany and think these would be too heavy in US$, also many of the ETFs available in the U.S. aren't available in Germany/Europe.

VGVE Vanguard FTSE Dev. World   
VERX Vanguard FTSE Europe ex UK 
VGWD Vanguard FTSE All-World  HighDividend
EQQQ Invesco Nasdaq-100  

VERX is there too put more weight on stocks in Euro (and other European currencies) to decrease exposure to US$ a bit. Could have chosen a purely Eurozone ETF, but I feel the addition of Switzerland/Scandivia leads to a better balance industry-wise.
 
VGWD is there basically to make sure that there are sufficient payouts per year to max out the tax-free capital gains per year in Germany. Could be dropped if/when payouts of the others are enough to reach the maximum.

EQQQ to put some more emphasis on growth stocks. Would have preferred MGK, but this is not available in Germany or at least not my bank.

&gt; Shareholders on Monday approved a plan to **convert nearly $1 billion of debt into equity and raise up to 400 million crowns ($39 million) from the sale of new shares** to help the airline survive the coronavirus pandemic.

&gt; Norwegian aims to sell new shares at 1.0 crown each, it said, far less than Tuesday's closing price of 4.80 crowns as it seeks to attract investors even while the debt conversion leads to a massive dilution of ownership stakes.

&gt; **If the process fails however, Norwegian Air is at risk of running out of money by mid-May** even though it only pays invoices vital to maintaining minimum operations, it said on April 27.

&gt; The debt conversion will hand majority ownership to the airline's creditors and **could leave current shareholders with just 5.2%**, and with further dilution for owners who do not take part in the share issue.

t3_gevst0,Vanguard’s Market Cap ETFs Are Not What They Seem,"I’m thinking of putting together a market cap etf portfolio with a 60/25/15 allocation from large to small. I’ve been looking at vanguards market cap blend ETFs and upon closer look them seem to not accurately reflect the traditional definitions of the market capitalizations they should represent. 

Generally, the market cap ranges are as follows...
Small: $300 Million to $2 Billion
Mid: $2 Billion to $10 Billion
Large: $10 Billion or Higher

The median market capitalization for each ETF should fall in line with these ranges if it is accurate.

Below are the main Vanguard Market Cap ETFs and the median market cap value for each.

VB: Small Cap ($3.6 Billion)
VO: Mid Cap ($13.4 Billion)
VV: Large Cap ($112.7 Billion)

Most of these ETFs have a median value above the usual metrics. The Small Cap ETF is really a Mid Cap ETF. The Mid Cap ETF is really a Large Cap ETF. The Large Cap ETF is valued in the middle of a Large Cap and a Mega Cap (Mega Cap being a value of over $200 Billion) so this seems ok to me.

There are other ETFs offered through Vanguard that more accurately hit the definition. These follow along the S&amp;P Index for each capitalization. They are listed below with the median market cap value.

VIOO: S&amp;P 600 Small Cap ($1.4 Billion)
IVOO: S&amp;P 400 Mid Cap ($4.3 Billion)
VOO: S&amp;P 500 Large Cap ($118.7 Billion)

With the exception of VOO, these other ETFs have a median value of about a third of the other respective funds and they are also traded much less. Only VOO has a substantial Total Net Asset Value.

VOO is worth a staggering $443.6 Billion. It’s cousin, VV is only worth $21.9 Billion. Clearly, investors prefer to hold VOO. The same is true for the others.

IVOO is worth $1.6 Billion, VO is worth $84.6 Billion.
VIOO is worth $1.7 Billion, VB is worth $69.3 Billion.

Investors clearly prefer the funds that don’t follow the metrics.

Why would vanguard throw in a substantial amount of stocks that are in the next market cap tier into funds of lesser value? Is it to smooth out the volatility that small caps and mid caps usually experience? Or have stocks gone up in value so much that the traditional definitions no longer fit and Vanguard is making their own definitions. Comparing a $10 Billion company today to what a $10 Billion company was 20 years is not a fair comparison. Since we’re in the age of Mega Caps, should the metrics be expanded across all fronts to accommodate this change?

*just found this explanation from Investopedia...

“large investments in small companies can actually have the effect of adversely affecting the share price of the small company being bought or sold in the fund. For this reason, small-cap stock funds that have high net assets tend to buy stocks of larger-capitalization companies, which can cause the fund to evolve into a mid-cap stock fund, getting away from the fund's initial focus. This is called style drift”",investing,vanguard market cap etf seem,thinking putting together market cap etf portfolio allocation large small looking vanguard market cap blend etf upon closer look seem accurately reflect traditional definition market capitalization represent generally market cap range follows small million billion mid billion billion large billion higher median market capitalization etf fall line range accurate main vanguard market cap etf median market cap value small cap billion mid cap billion large cap billion etf median value usual metric small cap etf really mid cap etf mid cap etf really large cap etf large cap etf valued middle large cap mega cap mega cap value billion seems etf offered vanguard accurately hit definition follow along index capitalization listed median market cap value vioo small cap billion ivoo mid cap billion voo large cap billion exception voo etf median value third respective fund also traded much voo substantial total net asset value voo worth staggering billion cousin worth billion clearly investor prefer hold voo true others ivoo worth billion worth billion vioo worth billion worth billion investor clearly prefer fund follow metric would vanguard throw substantial amount stock next market cap tier fund lesser value smooth volatility small cap mid cap usually experience stock gone value much traditional definition longer fit vanguard making definition comparing billion company today billion company year fair comparison since age mega cap metric expanded across front accommodate change found explanation investopedia large investment small company actually effect adversely affecting share price small company bought sold fund reason small cap stock fund high net asset tend buy stock larger capitalization company cause fund evolve mid cap stock fund getting away fund initial focus called style drift,vanguard market cap etf seem thinking putting together market cap etf portfolio allocation large small looking vanguard market cap blend etf upon closer look seem accurately reflect traditional definition market capitalization represent generally market cap range follows small million billion mid billion billion large billion higher median market capitalization etf fall line range accurate main vanguard market cap etf median market cap value small cap billion mid cap billion large cap billion etf median value usual metric small cap etf really mid cap etf mid cap etf really large cap etf large cap etf valued middle large cap mega cap mega cap value billion seems etf offered vanguard accurately hit definition follow along index capitalization listed median market cap value vioo small cap billion ivoo mid cap billion voo large cap billion exception voo etf median value third respective fund also traded much voo substantial total net asset value voo worth staggering billion cousin worth billion clearly investor prefer hold voo true others ivoo worth billion worth billion vioo worth billion worth billion investor clearly prefer fund follow metric would vanguard throw substantial amount stock next market cap tier fund lesser value smooth volatility small cap mid cap usually experience stock gone value much traditional definition longer fit vanguard making definition comparing billion company today billion company year fair comparison since age mega cap metric expanded across front accommodate change found explanation investopedia large investment small company actually effect adversely affecting share price small company bought sold fund reason small cap stock fund high net asset tend buy stock larger capitalization company cause fund evolve mid cap stock fund getting away fund initial focus called style drift

t3_ge351r,"[CNBC] California Attorney General and cities sue Uber and Lyft, alleging they misclassified workers as contractors","https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/05/california-ag-cities-sue-uber-and-lyft-over-worker-classification.html
&gt; 
&gt; California Attorney General Xavier Becerra is suing Uber and Lyft, alleging the ride sharing companies have misclassified their drivers as contractors. City attorneys from San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego have joined Becerra in the lawsuit.
&gt; 
&gt; The lawsuit gets to the heart of a recent debate between gig economy companies and California officials. The lawsuit is based on a California law that went into effect earlier this year, known as Assembly Bill 5 (AB5). Uber, Lyft and other companies opposed the law, which was created as a way to require gig economy companies to classify their drivers as employees, rather than contractors. The companies have said the law strips workers of flexibility in work that they enjoy, while government officials backing the bill say it affords workers key benefits they are otherwise denied as contractors.
&gt; 
&gt; “Uber and Lyft claim that properly classifying drivers as employees is incompatible with flexibility. That is a lie,” San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said in a statement. “There is no legal reason why Uber and Lyft can’t have a vast pool of employees who decide for themselves when and where they work – exactly as drivers do now.

t3_gek53d,Trying to understand the whys and hows of negative price in crude oil,"Disclaimer, this is going to be a long message.

With the oil market gone mad recently, I would like to have some insights from someone who is on the field. FYI, I have never worked in/with the oil industry, but as an opportunistic and enthusiastic learner, I would like to know what it takes to pull off a deal that would allow one to get paid for taking delivery of WTI crude oil.

So here are my thoughts and interrogations. Some of my questions can overlap with each other but anyway. All of them can be summed up in one question: ""If the same scenario of negative price occurs again in May for June's contract, how to proceed if I want panicked CL owners to pay me to take delivery of their crude oil? Then come the second top level question, how do I actually take delivery of this crude oil?""

But let's try to break this down into more elementary questions that have risen along my readings on the internet.

1. First about the delivery process. I don't understand very well how roles are split between different actors.

1)a) In CL contract specs, they talk about a Clearing House. What is it exactly? A quick tour on Google brought me to Oil &amp; Gas Asset Clearinghouse, is that the one? Is there an only one Clearing House?

1)b) Referring to that CL contract again, it's written that ""The Clearing House shall allocate Delivery Notices and Notices of Intention to Accept by matching size of positions to the extent possible"". Do I understand right if I say that it's the Clearing House that puts, nominatively, a bid in front of an ask? Isn't it up to the financial market to do that?

1)c) Apparently, some margin shall be submitted so the transaction can occur. What they call a margin in this CL contract is like a deposit, am I correct? Under which form this deposit has to be done? Money? How much? The equivalent of the whole transaction? Can you enlighten me about this margin thing? Especially when prices are negative, how this margin works?

1)d) Still in CL contract, they mention two companies: Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and Endbridge Pipeline (Ozark) LLC. Are they the only one companies handling pipelines and deliveries for CL contracts? Do they handle storage as well?

1)e) Are those two companies considered FCM? Or are FCM's completely different actors? How do FCMs interface with the Clearing House and the two companies mentioned in 1)d) ?

1)f) Can you explain me the difference between book-out, in-tank transfer and in-line transfer please? I'm definitely not familiar with those terms.

1)g) I read somewhere that delivery shall be made in accordance with all applicable Federal executive orders and all applicable Federal, State and local laws and regulation. Where can I find all those orders, laws and regulation?

1)h) Could you point me toward a FCM company?

1)i) What is the minimum amount of barrels required to be purchased so one can proceed to a delivery? I’m guessing that FCM/Clearing House/CME/Pipeline companies/Funds (big or small) won’t be interested in small transaction? What’s the smallest they toletate? I'd like to have an idea of the kind of money we are talking about.

1)j) CL contracts deal with WTI Light Sweet Crude Oil that is delivered to Cushing. Does this mean that WTI Light Sweet Crude Oil cannot be delivered anywhere else? Is any other type of crude delivered to Cushing?

2. Then, relatively to storage itself, I can't find any clear picture of storage capacity, that's  
quite confusing

2)a) I thought that the US Gulf coast is now equipped with plenty of storage capacity, like 55% of US capacity (in Houston, LOOP in Louisiana...). How come everyone talks about storage issues in Cushing? It feels like there is only Cushing in the US (only 13% of storage capacity). Isn't it possible to transfer that glut of oil to storage farms elsewhere?

2)b) Is it really an issue of storage shortage or is it more about midstream infrastructures (I mean for transportation) not being able to keep up with this abundance of crude?

2)c) What regulatory requirements do storage facilities have to meet? Where can I find them?

2)d) What if I decide to store the crude abroad? Will US authorities have a say in the regulatory requirements met (or not...) by the facility receiving the crude?

2)e) Is there an easy way to get the big picture/map of storage capacity in the US, in the Caribbean, in Central and South America?

3. About the trading/acquisition of barrels on financial markets aspects; I believe not  
anybody can buy CL contracts (therefore purchase barrels) on classic financial markets  
with classic brokers.

3)a) How to get access to this kind of transactions? I assume they are only large scale transaction aren’t they?

3)b) I didn't understand very well the difference between CME Globex and CME ClearPort... What use to do of those two ones? I got the impression that I had to be on one of those two ones to trade CL contracts.

3)c) How CME Globex and CME ClearPort are different from NYMEX? Isn't NYMEX supposed to be the exchange where CL contracts are traded?

3)d) What is traded exactly? USO or CL contracts?

3)e) I have identified some main stake holders from a financial/market point of view:

\-CME Group, apart from creating/emeting the CL contratcs and handling/supervising crude delivery in Cushing, what do they do?

\-USCF, which is a Fund that has created USO which is also a fund. If I understood correctly, USO shares are traded (under the form of an ETF) on NYMEX. This USO ETF is somehow (how?) related to CL contracts

\-This USO Fund would be managed by Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM). Why not directly by USCF?

\-ALPS, which is the distributing broker and handles the trading operation on the fund USO

3)f)i)Did I get the whole picture in terms of main players involved?

3)f)ii)Why does Bank of New York Mellon manage USO instead of USO itself or USCF?

3)f)iii) How CME Group and their CL contracts on one hand, and USCF/USO/BNYM/ALPS on another hand are related?

3)f)iv) Generally, can someone explain how all those players interact?

3)f)v) If prices go negative again, and I want to get paid to get crude delivered so that I can store it somewhere, which of those players do I need to get in touch with?

3)g) Is there any contract, other than CL of CME Group, that deal with WTI Light Sweet Crude Oil? Or do I have to assume that CME Group got the exclusivity on that type of oil?

3)h) In case I can't (for some reason) buy a very big bundle of CL contracts to big players like institutional funds (USCF, etc), how would it be possible to buy as many CLs to different retailer traders, make it a whole bundle myself and proceed to one big delivery?

3)i) USO has 30% of long CLs for June. What/Who is the second biggest detainers of CL contracts?

3)j) I have read that CME can force USO to shut down because with 30% of the contracts, USO could go bankrupt and in the end CME would have to take all the deliveries attached to the contrats. How can CME force USO to close? What's the deal between the two them? How are they related?

t3_gehwl1,weird AI ETF,"I just found AI ETF (QRFT).

It was listed in NYSE about 1 year ago and their website claims that it would be a good substitute for SPY ETF. 

After 1 year, their total return(including dividend) is really outperforming about 9% over SPY after fee, and the Sharpe ratio is about double. But it seems that none know it.

Does AI really work? It is made by a Korean AI company. How do you think??

t3_geormu,By now you've all seen the LORL dividend announcement.,"By now you've all seen the LORL dividend announcement. Here's how to play it,

If you buy $30p 6/19 with current mark @ $7.50 and you can in turn buy your shares for anything less than $22.49 then you could make money.

# Total cost of investment:

|Trade|Multiplier|Total Cost|
|:-|:-|:-|
|6/19 $30p w/ $7.50 mark|100|$750 premium|
|$22.49/share|100|$2,249 cost of shares|

Adjust as necessary depending on premium and share price. 

|$2,249 cost of shares|\+ $750 premium|= $2,999 for total investment cost|
|:-|:-|:-|


&amp;#x200B;

# How to make a ROI:

|$30 strike|\- $5.50 dividend |= $24.50 as new strike price|
|:-|:-|:-|


&amp;#x200B;

|Trade|Multiplier|Total Cost|
|:-|:-|:-|
|$24.50 new strike|100 |$2,450 from selling shares|
|$5.50 dividend|100|$550 from dividend|

&amp;#x200B;

|$2,450 for selling your shares|\+ $550 dividend|= $3,000 total return|
|:-|:-|:-|


 (Profit, not considering tax liability).

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: If you could buy 100 shares below $22.49 and the share price rises on the 14th as everyone is buying in, the put premium should also get cheaper. Buy 6/19 $30p for $7.50 or less. This would save you money on all sides and you could actually get a decent return not accounting for taxes.

t3_gejaoc,Analysis of penny stock WLL," 

For someone who is interested in penny stocks, here is my way to analyze WLL for your reference.

On April 1, WLL filed for chapter 11 to restructure. The price of WLL tumbled from 0.8-1 to 0.3-0.4 after the declaration. By the RTS (restructure term sheet) WLL filed to SEC on April 1, original stockholder will get 3% new issued shares (97% belongs to unsecured Note’s holder) and 15% warrants (4-5years duration), all subject to be diluted by the 8% stock stimulus package for the management and employees after restructuring.

According the “un-levered”, “low CAPEX” version pro-forma (lender Cleansing Materials) attached at the same filing, average FCF per year is 136m for the coming years. If we use 10x FCF for valuation, WLL’s equity value post-restructuring will be 1360m. If the Qty of new shares issued is the same as the original shares, there will be 91m post-restructuring shares outstanding. Thus, by estimation, stock price will be around 15 per share in the coming years if everything goes as the pro-forma. The value of each pre-restructuring share will be 15\*0.03\*0.92=0.414 after restructuring.

As for the warrants, exercise price is 110% and 125% of the amount of current unsecured note’s value, which is around 2B. According to the equity value we derived from the pro-forma, those warrants will not be in the money for the coming years. However, if the oil price surges tremendously within 4-5 years, say 60 USD up, those warrants might feedback fruitful return.

Furthermore, there are still 1B secured loan subject to be unimpaired by the RTS. How the company will pay the bill is still uncertain.

Generally speaking, evaluating company like this is highly speculative. In my opinion, the range of the estimated value of pre-restructuring WLL equity is very large, depends on how you assess the value of warrants and the feasibility of the pro-forma. I think price below 0.3 might be a bargain. How much markup you would like to pay will depend on how your confidence for the pro-forma and the perspective of oil price.

The investment for the penny stocks is never an easy job and requires much more detail study and check. The abnormal high return just reflects the extra efforts demanded for the time-consuming analysis and the super high speculative nature for those investments.",investing,analysis penny stock wll,someone interested penny stock way analyze wll reference april wll filed chapter restructure price wll tumbled declaration rts restructure term sheet wll filed sec april original stockholder get new issued share belongs unsecured note holder warrant year duration subject diluted stock stimulus package management employee restructuring according levered low capex version pro forma lender cleansing material attached filing average fcf per year coming year use fcf valuation wll equity value post restructuring qty new share issued original share post restructuring share outstanding thus estimation stock price around per share coming year everything pro forma value pre restructuring share restructuring warrant exercise price amount current unsecured note value around according equity value derived pro forma warrant money coming year however oil price surge tremendously within year say usd warrant might feedback fruitful return furthermore still secured loan subject unimpaired rts company pay bill still uncertain generally speaking evaluating company like highly speculative opinion range estimated value pre restructuring wll equity large depends ass value warrant feasibility pro forma think price might bargain much markup would like pay depend confidence pro forma perspective oil price investment penny stock never easy job requires much detail study check abnormal high return reflects extra effort demanded time consuming analysis super high speculative nature investment,analysis penny stock wll someone interested penny stock way analyze wll reference april wll filed chapter restructure price wll tumbled declaration rts restructure term sheet wll filed sec april original stockholder get new issued share belongs unsecured note holder warrant year duration subject diluted stock stimulus package management employee restructuring according levered low capex version pro forma lender cleansing material attached filing average fcf per year coming year use fcf valuation wll equity value post restructuring qty new share issued original share post restructuring share outstanding thus estimation stock price around per share coming year everything pro forma value pre restructuring share restructuring warrant exercise price amount current unsecured note value around according equity value derived pro forma warrant money coming year however oil price surge tremendously within year say usd warrant might feedback fruitful return furthermore still secured loan subject unimpaired rts company pay bill still uncertain generally speaking evaluating company like highly speculative opinion range estimated value pre restructuring wll equity large depends ass value warrant feasibility pro forma think price might bargain much markup would like pay depend confidence pro forma perspective oil price investment penny stock never easy job requires much detail study check abnormal high return reflects extra effort demanded time consuming analysis super high speculative nature investment

t3_gekbjf,Working on detecting potential fraudulent activity in company balance sheets,"So essentially, I designed a pretty basic fraudulent activity detector that screens through all US stocks on all US exchanges (assuming theres adequate data), but needed a bit of advice on two things.

1) when I ran it, a ton of companies pinged warnings  on the first indicator (just seeing if their Total Assets and Total liabilities matched their respective equations (Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Equity, and Total Liabilitities = Total Assets - Equity). For the most part a lot seemed within 1-2% off, so I adjusted the code to ignore if the numbers it +/- 3% off, but I'm still getting hits probably every 5th or so company that goes through, and a lot of them are like 20% off. Is there any other explanation for this? The equations themselves seem fine and when I run them through bigger companies who are constantly under a microscope, and the ratios work out. 

2) another indicator I have measures Operating Cash flow/Sales. Essentially, I have it so if the ratio falls below 1/3rd the previous quarters ratio, it gets flag, indicating that there was a substantial increase/stagnant sales without corresponding cash flow. This 1/3rd is just a placeholder for now.

So my 2 questions:
For first part, is this realistic that there could be some low levels of fraud in say 20% of all companies? A lot of the tickets are ones I've never heard of before, leaving me to believe thwyre a lot of smaller companies (havent had the chance to go through them individually).

Also it's less than fifth of the price of all time high. All relevant news headlines are negative which I assume is making this stock tank even more making this a potentially really profitable investment in the long term when things ease down.

Obviously the risk is bankruptcy. Compared to Southwest or Delta their fundamentals are pretty shit. High debt burden, low profit margins. They're burning over 50 million in cash a day.

They got the biggest loan and a grant from the government in the recent aid. And they're the biggest airline with over 100k employees (also with America in their name lol) which makes me think the fed will help them if shits hits the fan and they become really close to bankruptcy. I know they declared bankruptcy before but I believe this time government intervention is more likely due to the damage being caused by the corona.

t3_geipe5,Thoughts on CLO over the course of this recession?,"I'm starting to like reviewing Mayra Rodriguez Valladares articles over the past year or so on CLO.

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/mayrarodriguezvalladares/2019/06/11/non-banks-are-the-largest-holders-of-collateralized-loan-obligations-globally/#100c67296e95](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mayrarodriguezvalladares/2019/06/11/non-banks-are-the-largest-holders-of-collateralized-loan-obligations-globally/#100c67296e95)

&gt; I wrote the SEC asking for CLO data of publicly traded companies. I received a prompt response. “The SEC does not track how much public companies hold in CLOs.  That is not a required line item disclosure so we are not able to track it based on a company’s SEC filings.”

I'm more and more convinced CLO (lower tranches at the very least) are going to explode over the course of this recession. Seems to be a hidden danger if it's left off SEC filings, and the credit swamp is flooding wider by the day.

I don't see how they won't fail as S&amp;P downgrades roll, hedge funds see the risk and sell exposure, bond ETF sell the downgraded funds to buy investment grade, yields on junk bonds start to rise, and these companies finally croak and die when they really can't refinance any more.

t3_geip3y,How is the AMC vs Universal Studios tiff going to resolve?,"All the news articles are making it look like AMC fired the first shot by saying they won’t be playing universal films in their theaters at all anymore, but I think it’s obvious that universal instigated this by saying they would no longer honor the theatrical release window. 

I think this was a short sighted move on universal’s part. Yes, Trolls2 was wildly more successful than anticipated, but this was a result of such morbidly special circumstances that it can’t reasonably be used as a way to predict future success. I also wonder how many of those $20 rentals were accidental purchases from kids who just happened to have the remote in hand. 

With such a massive collection of movies available in every streaming platform’s catalog already built into the subscription fee, can we really assume $20-$30 for a 48 hour rental of a new release is going to become part of streaming culture? And if it does, that is still a fraction of the revenue a theater would generate from getting a family in the doors. 

I guess the question is this: are there enough families willing to pay for that rental fee, who might otherwise have waited until after the theatrical release to see the movie? And by “enough”, I mean significantly more than the number of families who would have gone to the theater but will choose to stream instead. 

My guess is no.

And now that AMC put their foot down (with cineworld joining their side), it will almost certainly be a net loss in revenue for Universal. 

So what will universal do? Hold their ground? Look for a compromise? Walk back the move entirely? Unless theaters get a say in the specific titles and the number of releases distributed this way every year, I can’t see them reaching a compromise any other way.",investing,amc universal studio tiff going resolve,news article making look like amc fired first shot saying playing universal film theater anymore think obvious universal instigated saying would longer honor theatrical release window think short sighted move universal part yes troll wildly successful anticipated result morbidly special circumstance reasonably used way predict future success also wonder many rental accidental purchase kid happened remote hand massive collection movie available every streaming platform catalog already built subscription fee really assume hour rental new release going become part streaming culture still fraction revenue theater would generate getting family door guess question enough family willing pay rental fee might otherwise waited theatrical release see movie enough mean significantly number family would gone theater choose stream instead guess amc put foot cineworld joining side almost certainly net loss revenue universal universal hold ground look compromise walk back move entirely unless theater get say specific title number release distributed way every year see reaching compromise way,amc universal studio tiff going resolve news article making look like amc fired first shot saying playing universal film theater anymore think obvious universal instigated saying would longer honor theatrical release window think short sighted move universal part yes troll wildly successful anticipated result morbidly special circumstance reasonably used way predict future success also wonder many rental accidental purchase kid happened remote hand massive collection movie available every streaming platform catalog already built subscription fee really assume hour rental new release going become part streaming culture still fraction revenue theater would generate getting family door guess question enough family willing pay rental fee might otherwise waited theatrical release see movie enough mean significantly number family would gone theater choose stream instead guess amc put foot cineworld joining side almost certainly net loss revenue universal universal hold ground look compromise walk back move entirely unless theater get say specific title number release distributed way every year see reaching compromise way

t3_ge858j,Buying an ETF that uses options to protect against downside risk: $NUSI,"I'm currently planning to enter the market and I'm concerned about volatility, since I would like access to the funds on a 7-10 year horizon. 

I came across an interesting ETF that uses an option collar strategy to protect against downside risk That is, it sells calls against the underlying securities and then uses the revenue to buy protective puts.

It's called **NUSI**, or *Nationwide Risk-Managed Income ETF*.

It's appealing to me for a few reasons:

* I looked at its performance during the recent crash and it outperformed everything else (SPY, QQQ, etc.): [https://i.imgur.com/y8p6uFb.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/y8p6uFb.jpg[/img])
* It pays out a generous dividend from the sale of call options, at an amount that is competitive with bond funds: [7.71%](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/funds-and-etfs/nusi/dividend-history) 
* Although it has a higher expense ratio, it would be easier to buy this than try to build my own downside protection (e.g., buying protective puts), which can be a full time job. 

My goals would be to avoid inflation risk and have reasonable returns without a large drawdown.

I had two questions:

1. What might be the risks with buying this ETF?
2. What would the tax treatment be when the stocks they trade have protective puts on them? I believe it resets the clock on capital gains. Are those taxes deducted by the fund manager from the overall returns or does it get paid by the holder when the 1099 is distributed?

t3_ge5k0q,Do you believe it is possible to determine a company's market value by just reading their financial statements?,"Most of us have heard that many great investors, such as Warren Buffett, love to read company's annual reports all day long. 

&gt; Warren Buffett has said he loves to curl up with companies’ annual reports. When asked how to get smarter, Buffett once held up stacks of paper and said he “read 500 pages like this every day. That’s how knowledge builds up, like compound interest.” 

&gt; Once Buffett determines the intrinsic value of the company as a whole, he compares it to its current market capitalization—the current total worth or price. If his intrinsic value measurement is at least 25% higher than the company's market capitalization, Buffett sees the company as one that has value.

That being said,  I've found some great (IMO) financial statements of a company that is somehow undervalued by investors.  I know some would argue it is important to know  the company business, competitors, etc. And I agree.

However, I would like to make an ""experiment"", and let you see first the numbers, without knowing nothing about the company. And then see if we're biased depending on countries/sectors/ethics,etc.

If you find this post interesting I will give you the name of company, so we can discuss the results after reading your unbiased value estimates.

t3_gegnaf,Which markets or industries do you see perform best in the next decades (geographic vs. industry focus vs. cap size)? How do you build this into a strategy and portfolio to maximize expected risk-adjusted future returns?,"I often get confused when people here argue whether one could beat ""the market"". Which ""market"" are they referring to? Assuming Equities, which equities and index? MSCI World? S&amp;P500? FTSE100? ASX200? Emerging markets? 

Many portfolios suggested here seem to suggest a strong U.S. bias for equities, and even an MSCI world would have almost 40% U.S. equity exposure. While it's true that the S&amp;P500 has had strong past returns over many time periods, there's plenty of research suggesting that over the same periods other markets have outperformed.

Let's assume for a minute that ""the market"" is the S&amp;P500 (or MSCI world index, irrelevant for my point). In times of low-cost ETFs widely available and being able to shift the weightings of one's portfolio relatively easily to replicate a strategy, I think it makes sense to compare this reference index and their **risk adjusted returns** to other indices along different dimensions. For equities, the obvious ones are

* **Geographic focus**  
Comparing reference indices in different countries can be an interesting exercise. Quite surprisingly, the Australian, South African, and Swedish stock market have had higher *risk adjusted* returns over different periods (16 years, 40 years, 116 years) than the S&amp;P500.  
[https://engineeredportfolio.com/2017/07/30/which-country-has-the-best-stock-market/](https://engineeredportfolio.com/2017/07/30/which-country-has-the-best-stock-market/)   
One might also look into historic performance of emerging markets vs. U.S, Europe or OECD.
* **Company size**  
There's plenty of research suggesting that small caps, at least in certain geographies, have historically outperformed large cap over long periods of time.  
[https://engineeredportfolio.com/2017/05/13/emerging-market-and-small-cap-outperformance-historical-comparison-of-international-equities/](https://engineeredportfolio.com/2017/05/13/emerging-market-and-small-cap-outperformance-historical-comparison-of-international-equities/) 
* **Company/market maturity**  
Over the past decade, 'growth' stocks have outperformed 'value'-stocks in the U.S. and other markets. 
* **Sector focus**  
Similarly, if one had put more emphasis on tech (e.g. NASDAQ) and placed their bet on buying QQQ, returns would have significantly higher since the past bull run. 

Now obviously past performance does not predict future returns, but it's one data point and can be considered alongside other factors. These include current valuations of such markets or sectors (particularly when it comes to investing lump sums at a certain point of time) and more importantly larger themes such as changes in political landscapes and the geopolitical environment, climate change and shift towards renewables, urbanization (or de-urbanization due to COVID?), digitization, etc.

With a lot of data on past performance of different indices available and reflecting on major socioeconomic and political trends that will shape our lives in the next decades, I'd be interested in creating a diversified portfolio using low-cost ETFs, which over the next 20-30 years is likely to outperform the classic bogleheads 3-fund portfolio or an MSCI world and potentially offer higher risk-adjusted returns compared to those indices. Suggestions should be evidence-based on a combination of past returns and outlook into the future, rather than saying ""just put your money into FANG or an AI or ROBO-ETF"".

With that in mind, which mix of markets, or sectors, do you see outperforming over the next decades compared to a S&amp;P500 or MSCI world reference index, how would you build a low-cost portfolio based on that strategy, and with which weightings?

t3_ge2x0n,"Aside from some speculation, I actually think the market is being fairly rational","There are a lot of people saying that the market should be going down right now. I used to be one of them, but I've backed out of that hypothesis. Now, I think the market is pretty well priced (aside from a few speculative cases). Here are my thoughts on that.

1. The companies with the biggest exposure to COVID-19 have already gone down in price. Airlines, cruise companies, hotels, casinos, oil etc. 
2. The companies that are going up in price mostly have good balance sheets or corporate debt options to cover 6+ months of operating expenses. Big oil companies are probably the best suited to weather this storm as they always carry a lot of cash to weather low oil price storms. 
3. Most companies without direct exposure to COVID-19 have a smaller market cap today than they did 3 months ago. Indicating an already expected lower cash flow for the foreseeable future due to recession. Q2-Q4 earnings will be trash, and that is mostly expected.
4. The affects of the virus and economic impact of a second wave has mostly been priced in to stock prices. Just because we get bad news about another wave or that we'll be in recession isn't going to affect stock prices much.
5. The initial affects and expected secondary effects of the recession have mostly been priced in. We all know there will be big layoffs in the coming months. 
6. Financial systems have been stabilized by the fed so the risk of financial institutions going belly up is pretty low. 

I know we hate to say it's all ""priced in"", but I can't find a good example a slow recovery isn't priced in. It seems like most stocks are expecting a slow 2020 with a pickup in 2021. That, to me, seems pretty reasonable. A early 2021 vaccine isn't guaranteed, but I don't think it's unreasonable to assume that we'll have news (either successful or indications that a vaccine is very close) for a vaccine late this year. Even if a vaccine hasn't been produced, we'll be looking at herd immunity in a few key areas. 

Some thing that may not be priced in right now, but are not guaranteed to happen (hence expecting them to happen is speculation).

1. An exceptionally long (2+ years) time before a vaccine is discovered. 
2. A very short immunity after being infected (only 1 year of immunity before getting reinfected). 
3. Second wave in China. 
4. A particularly brutal second wave in the USA.
5. Financial system collapse.
6. Particularly extensive depression heavily affecting large companies.
7. A swing left in politics hitting the cash value of big businesses. Biggest effect could be a halt in M&amp;A or serious anti-trust laws breaking up FAANG companies. 
8. Mid-Long term fossil fuel demand collapse.
9. Bankruptcies of publicly traded companies. I think this will cause the next bear market, but it's months away. There is still runway for companies with shitty balance sheets. And who's to say the fed won't step in to buy up shitty of shit junk bonds. 

In other words, most of the obvious stuff has been priced in.

With all that said, there is definitely quite a bit of speculation going on. Tesla and Amazon are the two biggest examples. Their stock price right now is expecting them to make 5-10x their current revenue. It's not inconceivable, but IMO it's very bullish on a 5 year timescale. Another example, USO seems to be bought up by retail investors pushing up oil prices speculating that oil demand will return this summer (and there won't be a second wave crashing prices again). If that's the case, we'll see the price of oil collapse again when the June contracts expire. 

So I don't expect a bull or bear market in the coming months.

t3_gdznhz,The safety of muni bonds when states' tax base is affected,"With the looming recession (if we aren't in it already), States' income  streams are going to be hit on both the income tax and sales tax fronts.  Some states are obviously in a better position than others (e.g. CA which has been running a budget surplus for a few years, whereas NY is cash strapped), but at what point does paying the bond obligations become an issue?  

Even if state gov'ts are well capitalized, some are issued by counties and backed by property taxes.  Using CMF as an example ""State Tax-Backed"" bonds form only ~30% of the portfolio.

Pair that with gov't likely issuing newer bonds to fund increased expenses brought on by Covid*, I don't see a case to hold muni bonds for the time being.  They've recovered a lot since the Fed provided the backstop.

t3_gdom79,On Ray Dalio's Online Presence,"Guys,

Can someone help me understand what Ray Dalio is trying to do. It strikes me as very odd that one of the world's wealthiest persons has time to spend online to post ""principles"" and daily platitudes on self-improvement. His LinkedIn posts are somewhat insightful, but coming from someone like him they come off as profoundly and strikingly boring. Is it me and my having much higher expectations of someone with $20bb+ fortune? Somehow I would expect such a billionaire to make a mark on the world far beyond cheesy, cheap rah-rah motivational quotes. What am I not getting? Or is it someone else behind his account, posting all that stuff. And if so why?

Why is one of the world's most brilliant investors and hedge fund managers looking to influence the world with cheesy, zero-cost motivational quotes ?

t3_gduff8,Why SoftBank invested in WeWork in the first place?,"I just happen to check several investments SoftBank invested in the US in the past few years. Many of them never took off. If you dig a little deeper, you will find many companies SoftBank invested call themselves ""technology"" company. In reality, most of them just add a little fancy tech into the existing operation on a particular industry and re-brand as ""technology"" start up.

For example:  Katerra. Softbank invested over $1B into it while the result is abysmal. It looks like this is a traditional construction company but led by former Flextronics's CEO. Katerra is plowing money into building new facilities while they can buy existing ones below replacement. Now, they are forced to close facilities they built a few years ago and laying off workers. (link:  [https://therealdeal.com/2019/12/16/softbank-funded-construction-startup-katerra-promised-a-tech-revolution-its-struggling-to-deliver/](https://therealdeal.com/2019/12/16/softbank-funded-construction-startup-katerra-promised-a-tech-revolution-its-struggling-to-deliver/) ) If Softbank wants innovation in this field, why not just buy a well established construction company and add hire some technology talents?  It should be way cheaper than put hundred of millions dollars into a so called tech start up? Would an established profitable general contractor like Manhattan Construction cost 1B?

Another one is Flexport. Is there any difference between Uber Freight and Flexport?

We all know SoftBank investment managers are pretty smart. They know most of their investment cannot change a particular industry or even remotely profitable in the long term. **Why they make this kind of mistakes in the first place?** If they want to invest in office rental business, shouldn't they buy Regus? Regus is profitable and operated by a good hand. They can buy majority shares and hire technology talents to add some features in their operations and then IPO it.",investing,softbank invested wework first place,happen check several investment softbank invested past year many never took dig little deeper find many company softbank invested call technology company reality add little fancy tech existing operation particular industry brand technology start example katerra softbank invested result abysmal look like traditional construction company led former flextronics ceo katerra plowing money building new facility buy existing one replacement forced close facility built year ago laying worker link softbank want innovation field buy well established construction company add hire technology talent way cheaper put hundred million dollar called tech start would established profitable general contractor like manhattan construction cost another one flexport difference uber freight flexport know softbank investment manager pretty smart know investment cannot change particular industry even remotely profitable long term make kind mistake first place want invest office rental business buy regus regus profitable operated good hand buy majority share hire technology talent add feature operation ipo,softbank invested wework first place happen check several investment softbank invested past year many never took dig little deeper find many company softbank invested call technology company reality add little fancy tech existing operation particular industry brand technology start example katerra softbank invested result abysmal look like traditional construction company led former flextronics ceo katerra plowing money building new facility buy existing one replacement forced close facility built year ago laying worker link softbank want innovation field buy well established construction company add hire technology talent way cheaper put hundred million dollar called tech start would established profitable general contractor like manhattan construction cost another one flexport difference uber freight flexport know softbank investment manager pretty smart know investment cannot change particular industry even remotely profitable long term make kind mistake first place want invest office rental business buy regus regus profitable operated good hand buy majority share hire technology talent add feature operation ipo

t3_ge41ef,Viable options strategy?,"So I’ve been looking at options and thinking about different strategies, and I was wondering if this one was viable. 

It’s similar to a synthetic long where you buy a call and sell a put except that they are not for the same strike price or expiry. You would buy an OTM call for a short expiry and sell a put for a OTM somewhat further out expiry.

The sale of the put pays for the call. This means that profits are realized at or below the strike price. So even if the stock doesn’t move upward you are at least breaking even. This eliminates the risk of loss due to sideways price movement.

This of course does increase risk if the stock price were to fall, but depending on the circumstances there may be a low probability of that happening. 

For example, let’s say you thought EURN was going to have an excellent earnings announcement. EURN is currently at $10 posting earnings 5/7. You can buy a $12.5 Call for $0.38 for 5/15 expiry. You can sell a $5 Put for $0.40 for 8/21 expiry. So you are overall ITM upon executing. Your total possible risk is $480 if the stock falls to $0, but the likelihood of losing money at all is extremely low because EURN hasn’t been less than $7 since 2013. If your bet pays off, you could even buy out the put contract if it was making you nervous due to the longer expiry and it should be cheaper at that point. 

So is this a viable strategy? Does it already have a name? Is there a better way?",investing,viable option strategy,looking option thinking different strategy wondering one viable similar synthetic long buy call sell put except strike price expiry would buy otm call short expiry sell put otm somewhat expiry sale put pay call mean profit realized strike price even stock move upward least breaking even eliminates risk loss due sideways price movement course increase risk stock price fall depending circumstance may low probability happening example let say thought eurn going excellent earnings announcement eurn currently posting earnings buy call expiry sell put expiry overall itm upon executing total possible risk stock fall likelihood losing money extremely low eurn since bet pay could even buy put contract making nervous due longer expiry cheaper point viable strategy already name better way,viable option strategy looking option thinking different strategy wondering one viable similar synthetic long buy call sell put except strike price expiry would buy otm call short expiry sell put otm somewhat expiry sale put pay call mean profit realized strike price even stock move upward least breaking even eliminates risk loss due sideways price movement course increase risk stock price fall depending circumstance may low probability happening example let say thought eurn going excellent earnings announcement eurn currently posting earnings buy call expiry sell put expiry overall itm upon executing total possible risk stock fall likelihood losing money extremely low eurn since bet pay could even buy put contract making nervous due longer expiry cheaper point viable strategy already name better way

With all of the memes and jokes about ""money printing"" going around, and the news about the federal reserve possibly buying corporate bonds, I think it's very easy to develop a distorted view of what's going on at the federal reserve. Just from social media, you may be inclined to believe the federal reserve is ramping up it's rate of ""Money creation""- I've seen that sentiment reflected heavily on this subreddit. But that sentiment conflicts with the stats.

At the start of the pandemic panic in the states, The federal reserve was Buying $75 Billion in treasuries per day.

As you can see from the link above, this has been significantly wound down throughout April. By mid April they were down to $30 Billion per day, and now, they're only planning to buy $8 Billion in treasuries per day.",investing,federal reserve significantly winding treasury purchase,meme joke money printing going around news federal reserve possibly buying corporate bond think easy develop distorted view going federal reserve social medium may inclined believe federal reserve ramping rate money creation seen sentiment reflected heavily subreddit sentiment conflict stats start pandemic panic state federal reserve buying billion treasury per day see link significantly wound throughout april mid april billion per day planning buy billion treasury per day,federal reserve significantly winding treasury purchase meme joke money printing going around news federal reserve possibly buying corporate bond think easy develop distorted view going federal reserve social medium may inclined believe federal reserve ramping rate money creation seen sentiment reflected heavily subreddit sentiment conflict stats start pandemic panic state federal reserve buying billion treasury per day see link significantly wound throughout april mid april billion per day planning buy billion treasury per day

\- FB ecosystem

This is the stock that i believe is invested in the right places and has a path forward in the global market. I work as a React developer in fintech and I greatly enjoy their technology. The reason I stopped using snapchat was because I couldn't use it on low connection in Mexico, but Instagram worked marvelously. I use Whatsapp to stay in touch with my family in mexico and Facebook to stay in touch with my mom. There's something extremely powerful about that in my opinion.

They're conservative with their push and development of camera  and VR technology which is wise in my opinion give the many opportunities that exist in that space. They're pushing along with fintech in India, again with small business through Whatsapp. And they provide a suite of customer services for small business and entrepeneurs.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Microsoft

I think they will have a great run during the cloud era of software development. Their acquiring of Github AND NPM goes to show how in touch they are with developer servicing.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Paypal

Paypal has a marvelous history and is a battle tested pioneer in the fintech space. I see them repeating their previous successes by acquiring Honey. I work with Honey in the fintech space and now I'm understanding that Paypal has an auto coupon scraper on my Amazon purchases while my Visa ones don't. This is the forward thinking I love from Paypal despite not being as flashy as Square.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Disney

Disney is quintessential american entertainment. I believe their deep roots in American culture and the entertainment industry will provide a solid bedrock for them for the generations to come.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Waste Management

Sanitation and environmental, like internet connection technology, are about the same when it comes to market penetration. It is a scarcity. Sanitation is a critical part of any society's development and wellbeing. I think WM will be there to benefit from increased urbanization and industriousness from technology and wealth growth.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Kansas City Southern

I'm Mexican and my family are avocado farmers. I believe in the future prospects of Mexico and its relationship with its neighbors. Mexico is a bustling nation and many youth are international students that carry degrees. This is a far cry from having military policing streets in rural neighborhoods decades ago. Kansas city southern is part of the supply chain that connects Mexico to main industrious Mexican states like Monterrey, Jalisco, and Michaocan. I like rail in this regard because it's a lot of weight in one operation of heavy materials. So Canadians that use Mexican mining will also benefit from this railroad.

\- Nintendo

I believe in the future of gaming as a market and if I were to take a shot at who would be the most stable, I would vote for Nintendo. Like Facebook, they approach the family unit and grow generationally. I love their curveball approach to gaming and I think that creativity, along with it's customers trust, will be something I can hold onto for a long time versus companies that have a history of developing games like Call of Duty or World of Warcraft. Nintendo can take different forms: in the living room, at sweaty tournaments, online, mobile, on your phone, on a TV, in the movies, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**Closely watching**

\- United Health or Cigna

This is only going to grow and wont change due to American politics for 8 years at a minimum.

\- Cisco

Same as Microsoft but for IT.

\- Impossible Foods IPO

I've been vegetarian for 10 years and Impossible Burgers has been one of the most mindblowing experiences of my life. The product is phenomenal and on a league of its owned compared to Beyond Meat. IMHO Beyond taste like cheap school lunchroom burgers and Impossible tastes like something I would be excited to feed my family. If their pork products are great then I am ALL in because Chicken products are by far the easiest thing to replicate. I'm extremely excited about this product.

\- Visa

They make a ton of money on transactions. I saw them hiring for blockchain development so it leads me to believe that they're adapting.

\- Square

I work in the fintech space and I like their modest approach to financial services. Their acquiring of a bank charter is actually incredibly important due to all the procurement and legal processes that go behind being a fintech company (abiding by federal security laws, etc). The one reason I like Chase banking is because I enjoy their app. I see Square as a competitor to Chase, surprisingly.

\- Apple

Apple designs its products with customer service in mind. I think the future of education technology will likely go to Apple because of this. Their screens and cameras are wonderful and I can see them pioneering computer vision products because of this. They are THE American Tech company.

\- TMobile

Aggressive as hell and grew to be a large player through savvy moves across time. Their customer service is a highlight for me.

\- JPM

Customer service for banking is unmatched IMO. If any legacy banker will make it across changes, I believe Chase is doing what it takes to adapt and think forward.

\- Planet Fitness

$10 gyms, clean, and casual enough for the general population. You can't beat $10 gym membership when you're broke as fuck. I've been a heavy lifter before and still used Planet fitness in my transitions across states and whatnot. I need to look at their numbers more closely.

\- Volkwagen

I trust Europe and Japan to take EVs more seriously. I don't know who will seriously come close to competing with Tesla in the long run but they'll have to.

\- Panasonic

Panasonic, much like AMD, did not immediately reflect the value of what they have produced. AMD did not explode inline with bitcoin or cheaper GPU consumption, in the same way Panasonic did not reflect a massive spike in price after speculation in Tesla grew. They're an important arm to the EV market that spreads across many players ranging from Tesla to Toyota to big tech.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Lyft

I think Lyft's focus on customer service and regional clientele will pay off against Uber, who is growing too quickly and spreading thin. Lyft will benefit from the development of computer vision and Big tech's interest in automanufacturing.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Crypto (Bitcoin or XRP)

I like crypto as a technology as a software engineer. I see the value in a faster process for procuring and exchanging legal tender that does not have to go through the bottleneck of the ACH process or through legal issues like the PATRIOT ACT or the Bank Secrecy Act. It still fundamentally respects those laws without the frustrations of banking service bottlenecks.  I think the halvening protocol has an interesting affect on Bitcoin and supply and the market that it's trying to generate.

t3_gdr0ol,Renewable and clean energy ETFs?,"What do you guys think about ETFs that focus solely on clean energy, funds such as ICLN and ACES.

They're a bit all over the place performance wise, and a few of them are brand new. Prices are low, and it seems to me like a good time to get in, before renewable energy really takes off big time.

But do they include the right companies? Are they well managed? Looking through the portfolios, some of the holdings look like they are focused on residential or home solar products, not industrial/utility scale projects.

Are these ETFs part of a solid portfolio in renewable energy? Or just meme funds designed to lure eco-conscious investors? Do you see the future of renewable energy as becoming dominated by newer, different firms? Or will the established big energy companies simply take it over and buy up the smaller companies?

t3_gdqlps,What does everyone think about investing in AI / Robotics?,"There's been a big wave of AI being pushed lately with Smart Homes, Self Driving cars, and many more industries. 

I've noticed a few companies in the fast food industry have already come out with many automated processes for doing things. It seems like these AI / Robots could be very useful in the future, especially when you look at the lack of human workers available during times like this. The big issue I see them having so far is that the cost to buy one of these machines is still very very high and would take a long time to be worth it.

My question is do you guys think now is a good time to invest in these companies while their stocks are still low or wait a few years for them to work out the bugs, become more cost effective, and start becoming more mainstream. I think these machines will eventually replace the human workers in many industries like fast food, question is when do you think that  will happen and when do you think a good time to invest would be?

t3_gdt1zz,"IBM and Red Hat expand their telco, edge and AI enterprise offerings","IBM has struggled to grow its overall revenue in recent years, but has found a winning formula with its Cloud and Cognitive Software division, which provides businesses with hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence capabilities. Revenues from that segment were up 5% year over year in the first quarter, even with the initial impact of the coronavirus pandemic, and that increase followed 8.7% growth in the fourth quarter. \[The Motley Fool\]

“The public clouds do extraordinary things and they’re great partners of ours, but their primary business is creating these homogeneous services, at massive volumes, and saying ‘if your workloads fit into this, we can run it better, faster, cheaper etc.’ And they have obviously expanded out. They’ve added services. They are not saying we can put a box on-premise, but you’re still fitting into their model.” - IBM's President Jim Whitehurst

On the news side, IBM is launching new services to automate business planning, budgeting and forecasting, for example, as well as new AI-driven tools for building and running automation apps that can handle routine tasks either autonomously or with the help of a human counterpart. The company is also launching new tools for call-center automation. \[TC\]

t3_gdvlkz,Long GameStop,"Hi guys, I'm long GameStop and have been long for about a month now. I swooped in on a bunch of shares a month ago when the price was thrown down to $2.80, and have a cost basis now around $3.50. I am still long, as I think this stock is way oversold with nearly 100% short interest and unlike other retailers, I think this company has actually benefitted from the coronavirus lockdown.

With new consoles coming out, good management focusing on paying down debt and the coronavirus allowing the company to clear out old outdated gaming inventory and close brick and mortar locations that are cash flow negative, GameStop will have a headstart in a post-corona world. I also find their vision of ""becoming the social and cultural hub for gaming"" pretty interesting. People have mentioned that gaming cafes fail, but GameStop is also a retailer who thrives off of foot traffic. GameStop was cheap last month, and is still cheap now trading at a P/B of 0.87.

I would also like to note that a lot of the time, being right and a contrarian is one of the only ways to profit immensely on the stock market.  Last month, when I was doubling down on my position, the popular opinion on this forum was that GameStop is failing.

t3_gdoqrk,Cash Management ETFs,"There was a thorough [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/bb06dn/basic_cash_management_etfs/) from a while back that gave a pretty good overview of some cash management ETFs. They fell a lot more than I would have expected during mid-march (see below). I noticed that some of them fell by only 0.25% back in the 20% decline of December 2018, so seeing a 5-10% fall during March was kind of scary to be honest because it's a good example of how dysfunctional the markets were. The financial system was falling off a cliff. Only the government backed short term treasury ETFs held up. I'm also surprised that prime money market mutual funds did not break the buck. 

Anyway, is there any way we can trust the moneymarket-like ETFs like ICSH or JPST at this point?  It seems like money markets are being funded by the Fed right now, but I'm not sure if there's a way to really know if excessive risk is still there. I do not want to risk dollars to make pennies. My broker has very high minimums of up to $100k on their prime money market funds paying 0.7% which I find ridiculous. I wish I could get the Vanguard prime money market fund VMMXX without a fee but I can't. I am looking for somewhere to park a house and car down payment, and also a very small portion of my IRAs are in cash right now.

t3_gdlncx,Competitive prospects of companies like airlines that have taken on massive debt,"With Buffett selling his airline stocks and what is going on with other firms getting bailouts I am still very puzzled by something I am not seeing being discussed in a macro sense.

How are these firms with huge debt going to compete? In the case of airlines discount competitors were popping up all the time. If the same holds true post recession (or whatever it becomes) the existing players will basically be completely underwater on their assets and their debt. Boeing could now be making deals to produce planes for players that don't need to pay crews or maintainance until after this is over. Everything suggests they will face stiffer competition post recession.

In short I see firms like this being made uncompetative by the cost of servicing their debt - there will be competitors who lack these problems. The barriers to entry (asset prices, gate access fees) will also be reduced by this situation.

The same thing goes for other sectors.

Moovit’s free mobile navigation app provides transit information to more than 750 million users in 100 countries.

Last month it launched an emergency mobilization service, which was created for transit agencies and enterprises during the COVID-19 pandemic.

t3_gdjhpc,Rate these 2 Portfolios: Actively managed vs Passively managed,"Hello all, I would appreciate any of your inputs. I've done quite a bit of research and arrived at these portfolios for long term dividend growth + yield.  I have a pretty long investment time horizon so there's essentially no bonds. I live in Canada, and like to take advantage of tax benefits such as the Canadian Dividend Tax Credit, which is why my portfolio is Canadian focused.

Due to recent events and quantitative easing by the Fed, I am worried about the stock market trading sideways for a long time similar to the Nikkei 225 in Japan. Therefore, I believe a dividend/yield focused portfolio provides a steady source of growth in the absence of capital appreciation.

One of these portfolios seeks higher yield using actively managed strategies (such as artificial intelligence via HAL.TO), while the other portfolio seeks to minimize MER. I will list them below and briefly explain my rationale:

# Portfolio 1 (Actively Managed):

* CI First Asset Canadian REIT ETF (RIT.TO) - 40% allocation
* Horizons Canadian Active Dividend ETF (HAL.TO) - 30% allocation
* BMO Global High Dividend Covered Call ETF (ZWG.TO) - 30% allocation

Total MER: 0.717%

**Rationale:**

I know the management fee is high, but if you check the annualized performance since inception of RIT.TO and HAL.TO, they are 9.20% and 7.27%. I know passive management generally beats active management, but in this case it might be different. Real estate is generally a sector where active management can provide more value than in stocks, due to more inefficiencies to exploit. HAL.TO uses artificial intelligence and big data to predict dividend yield and sustainability, which seemed to have provided superior returns so far.

Plus, the real estate market might be in big trouble, so the active management of RIT.TO might be useful to implement proactive/defensive plays. It's also interesting HAL.TO positioned it's allocation to utilities as its top sector allocation, since utilities tend to perform the best during a market downturn.

In terms of BMO covered call ETF, I see it as a pseudo-bond that provides good yield even in economic downturns. I chose ZWG.TO because it is geographically diversified compared to the other BMO covered call ETFs. I've heard good things about ZWH.TO (USA only), because the covered call premiums are higher in the US (though ZWG.TO is almost 60% US).

# Portfolio 2 (Passively Managed):

* Vanguard FTSE Canadian Capped REIT Index ETF (VRE.TO) - 40% allocation
* iShares Core MSCI Canadian Quality Dividend Index ETF (XDIV.TO) - 30% allocation
* iShares Core MSCI Global Quality Dividend Index ETF (XDG.TO) - 30% allocation

Total MER: 0.258%

**Rationale:**

These are the lowest fee ETFs I could find compared to similar competition. I personally really like REITs which is why I am so heavy in real estate, and VRE.TO is the cheapest compared to other REIT etfs like XRE.TO and ZRE.TO. I also like the MSCI High Dividend Yield Indices that XDIV.TO and XDG.TO tracks, which uses smart beta methods (Tangerine's high dividend mutual fund also tracks this index).

t3_gcc06x,1 in 6 publicly traded U.S. companies did not earn enough to cover their interest payments going into the COVID-19 crises.,"I think a big assumption in the V-shaped recovery theory is that the U.S. economy was relatively healthy going into the crises. And that once demand returns to normal, businesses will continue to post record high profits. 

This idea couldn't be farther from the truth. [Data published in the WSJ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/10/coronavirus-markets-economy-corporate-debt/) on March 10, 2020 showed that: 

* 1 in 6 publicly traded U.S. companies did not earn enough to cover their interest payments before the COVID-19 crises. 
* In the first half of 2019, 40% of all leveraged loans went to companies with a debt-to-earnings ratio of 6:1 or higher. 
* [the IMF conducted a stress test](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/14/investing/corporate-debt-coronavirus/index.html) that showed an economic crises half the size of 2008 would put 40% of corporate debt at risk of default in the 8 of the largest world economies.

I find it very odd that stories like these were EVERYWHERE in March, 2020. Then as stocks began to skyrocket and firms started making back losses, they practically vanished from the media.

t3_gc5tfm,Warren Buffet's Cash Pile Surges to Record $137 Billion,"Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. spent the first quarter building up cash as the coronavirus slowdown started to grip the U.S.

* Berkshire ended the period with $137 billion of cash, a record for the conglomerate. That was up almost $10 billion from the end of 2019, while the famed investor spent just a net $3.5 billion buying shares of his and other companies.

### Key Insights

* Buffett, Berkshire’s chairman and chief executive officer, has been on the hunt for higher-returning investments such as acquisitions or stock purchases for years, but has struggled amid what he called “sky-high” prices.
* Buffett will host Berkshire’s annual meeting virtually on Saturday, starting at 3:45 p.m. in Omaha with key deputy Greg Abel by his side. Buffett’s longtime business partner, Charlie Munger, won’t be in attendance. Follow the TopLive blog here.
* Berkshire’s first-quarter net income plunged to a loss of $49.7 billion, driven by unrealized losses in the massive stock portfolio.
* Berkshire bought $1.8 billion of stocks on a net basis in the period as the market plunged amid widespread fallout from Covid-19.
* Berkshire took a more cautious approach to stock buybacks in the first quarter, repurchasing just $1.7 billion. It spent a [record](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-22/buffett-spends-record-2-2-billion-buying-up-berkshire-shares) $2.2 billion on buybacks during the last three months of 2019.

t3_gd7hyk,daily swims during crash/historical data,"I'm sure the landslide from Feb 20 - March 23 this year is still fresh in everyone's mind. 

I sat that one out because i was still working during that time and knew even less about stocks/trading than I do now(still new to this and learning), but I saw the profits you can make by buying puts at the right time. 

one of the strategy I saw some people using during that time was buy puts on the green days and take profit immediately the day after. I still remember the market was ""predicable"" in the sense that everybody know it's crashing, and those greens days are almost guarantee to be followed with bloodbath red days after. That pattern repeated over the course of bit over 3 weeks.

Now my question is : is this a common characteristic for a steep market drop? I'm only taking about the big plunge here. In the past historical charts when you see the market take a nose dive, it's basically a straight line heading down, but I can imagine it wont red days for weeks straight, it will probably have some strong green days mix with every 2/4 red days?

t3_gd0iyp,Why I think $opk will double in the next few weeks," Before I lay out a BUY thesis, let me first address the negativity:

* ""It's a penny stock"" - No it's not. The last closing price is $2.13 with a market cap of $1.43b. Widely spoken $nat ($6/share) here is under a billy.
* ""It's a pump and dump"" - No it's not. 39.85% insiders + 26.36% institutional holdings. You should realize that when dumb money from Robinhood follows anything in \~$1bil range, it's gonna move prices temporarily.
* ""The CEO was caught for pump &amp; dump"" - Sure, but not really. The CEO is an old Pharma billionaire. All the previous pharma companies he touched turned into gold. He owns 33.86% of Opko and continues to buy $100k+ worth of shares on every damn dip. Sure, he may have done some sketchy stuff on the side, but most of his wealth came from building empires. For the allegation btw, he got away with only [$5.5 mil](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/28/biotech-billionaire-philip-frost-agrees-to-proposed-judgment-in-sec-case.html)
* ""It's heavily shorted"" - Sure, 25.14% of the float is shorted, but I'm here to tell why shorts are about to get squeezed.

Buy Thesis. Not like I have much experience, but I've never seen a company this undervalued. Why?

* Testing, Testing, Testing. #1 reason to buy Opko is that it fully owns - Bioreference Labarotories - top 3 largest commercial labs in US (Quest &amp; LabCorp are two others). Drugs like remdesivir will come and go, but until universal vaccine rolls around, (which is mid to end 2021) people will need to get tested and retested to prevent the spread. Two weeks ago, BioRef's tests accounted for [20% nationwide](https://www.menendez.senate.gov/news-and-events/press/menendez-pascrell-call-on-trump-admin-to-provide-greater-support-to-commercial-labs-testing-for-covid-19). That was when they were doing 15k tests/day. Two days ago on CNBC (yes, that alone should pump the price on Monday), the CEO said hey will be at [40k tests/day very soon](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/05/01/getting-covid-19-tests-where-they-need-to-be.html) . [600k tests](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/05/01/getting-covid-19-tests-where-they-need-to-be.html) performed already in the past 7 weeks at an average of 12.2k/day. Imagine a minimum of 50 more weeks at 40k/day. The demand is enormous. All of BioRef's testing cites are contracted. [Rite Aid](https://www.riteaid.com/corporate/news/-/pressreleases/news-room/2020/rite-aid-expands-covid-19-on-site-testing-24-locations-now-open-across-eight-states), [pretty much most of New York,](https://www.opko.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/380/opko-healths-bioreference-laboratories-and-nyc-health) [New Jersey](https://www.opko.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/381/opko-healths-bioreference-laboratories-and-state-of-new), [Detroit](https://www.opko.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/382/opko-healths-bioreference-laboratories-and-city-of-detroit), [Miami](https://www.opko.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/383/opko-healths-bioreference-laboratories-and-city-of-miami).
* [Abbot's 5 min ](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/05/01/getting-covid-19-tests-where-they-need-to-be.html)[test](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/05/01/getting-covid-19-tests-where-they-need-to-be.html) is not highly accurate. Also, it alone can't sustain the demand for all of US because it's simply not profitable for Abbot to mass-produce expensive device that is only useful for a year. For starters, BioRef doesn't sell test kits. They make money by putting swabs in your nose and analyzing those results.
* You know what else you heard: antibody tests. Guess what, BioRef can do that too. On the CNBC interview, he mentions that by mid-May, they'll be at 400k antibody tests a day. You know what all that means??
* Revenue!!! Numbers aren't public so best we can do is conservative ballpark. $25\*400K/day = $10mil/day for antibody + $50\*40k/day for conventional = $2mil/day. **$12 mil for a min of 300 days is $3.6 billion** **in revenue**. Opko as a whole did $902 million last year. 80% of the revenue comes from [BioRef](https://www.opko.com/investors/sec-filings/annual-reports/content/0000944809-20-000007/0000944809-20-000007.pdf). Plus it's doing a bunch of other stuff like 4k score, [Rayadale](https://www.opko.com/what-we-do/our-research/rayaldee), and long-awaited [Samotragon trial results due in June](https://www.opko.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/386/somatrogon-phase-3-pediatric-trial-results-will-be).
* The stock closed at $2.13 on Friday. When the announcement of testing came out in early March, it was pumped from $1.5 to almost $3 in 3 days. It was later dumped and shorted even more to an all-time low of $1.11. Now it's making an aggressive comeback. The stock was as high as $19.2 in mid-2015. Partial reasons for the decline from the highs were unsuccessful trial results and pump&amp;dump allegations I mentioned above. But **primarily**, shorts thought that Phil Frost buying BioReference Labs for $1.47 billion was unjustified. Two other competitors $DGX and $LH are $15 billion each. Now it's paying dividends.

So if a buyer of a CDS has the ""spread"" on the CDS tighten that means that they would be paying the seller of the CDS less of a premium, but the CDS asset itself would be depreciate in value since default of the underlying asset is less likely. Then on the flip side if the CDS spread widens then the buyer is paying a higher premium to the seller, but the underlying asset of the CDS is more likely to default and the CDS becomes more valuable to the buyer. In that case the seller would ideally like to redeem (buy back) the CDS so they don't have to pay out in the underlying asset actually defaults.

t3_gcv79c,Warren Buffett's Favorite Indicator is Kinda Wrong. More like incomplete,"Over the past few days I’ve encountered several articles mentioning the Buffett indicator and how it’s flashing red, signaling dire times ahead. For those of you that don’t know, the Buffett indicator tells investors whether the stock market as a whole is overvalued relative to GNP or not. For the past few months and years, it has been signalling that the stock market is deadly overpriced, reaching significantly higher than the Great Financial Crisis in the past few months. I think it’s missing one piece of information that makes it seem slightly more worse than it seems.

The Buffett indicator is simply the Total Stock Market Capitalization/Gross National Product (GNP). GNP is quite similar to GDP, with net property income from abroad added to the mix. For the US, this doesn’t add much of anything, only about a 1-2% change from GDP.  The more interesting part is the market capitalization of the stock market. In the US it is usually measured by the Wilshire 5000 Full Cap Price Index or a similar all-encompassing index. 

[https://www.gurufocus.com/stock-market-valuations.php](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock-market-valuations.php). 

In the link above, you’ll see that the Buffett Indicator is currently at around 132% (as of the time of writing this). This nets it a value above 120% - which is meant to be the “significantly overpriced” territory. Looking at the chart provided in the link, we see that the market has been in that significantly overpriced territory since the start of 2017 and has continuously risen until the coronavirus led market crash. 

As explained in the link, the lines in this calculation are drawn around a one to one ratio between market capitalization and GNP. I’d like to note here the underlying assumption behind the indicator: The real value of the market capitalization should be around the same size of GDP.  This assumption, as far as I can tell, doesn’t hold any meaning over the long term. 

Think about it, this means that the value of the stock market should always stay constant with respect to the size of the economy. How could that be true, when the companies represented in the stock market have been growing their international customer bases while the rest of the economy hasn’t, meaning their growth relative compared to the stock market companies' growth is smaller. Shouldn’t we expect that over time, especially over the past 10 years with the widespread use of the internet, large companies have grown beyond their usual reach and come to represent a larger chunk of GDP than they used to?

To verify this claim, one would need to get their hands on data that shows the contributions of companies represented in the stock market to overall GNP. If there is a rise in that value as I suspect there is, this would mean that the Buffett Indicator needs to be modified by using the total contribution to GNP by stock market companies instead of GNP directly. 

I’d like to note that I have no idea if what I suggest here is true, or if I'm missing something blatantly obvious. But to me it stands clear that there should be a coefficient associated with this indicator that represents the relative size of stock market contributions to GNP vs GNP itself. Otherwise, the underlying assumption is too heavy to hold true over long periods of time. With that said, the actual value of the Buffett indicator should be significantly lower than it is today, to reflect the rise in stock market generated GDP over the past 10 years.",investing,warren buffett favorite indicator kinda wrong like incomplete,past day encountered several article mentioning buffett indicator flashing red signaling dire time ahead know buffett indicator tell investor whether stock market whole overvalued relative gnp past month year signalling stock market deadly overpriced reaching significantly higher great financial crisis past month think missing one piece information make seem slightly worse seems buffett indicator simply total stock market capitalization gross national product gnp gnp quite similar gdp net property income abroad added mix add much anything change gdp interesting part market capitalization stock market usually measured wilshire full cap price index similar encompassing index link see buffett indicator currently around time writing net value meant significantly overpriced territory looking chart provided link see market significantly overpriced territory since start continuously risen coronavirus led market crash explained link line calculation drawn around one one ratio market capitalization gnp like note underlying assumption behind indicator real value market capitalization around size gdp assumption far tell hold meaning long term think mean value stock market always stay constant respect size economy could true company represented stock market growing international customer base rest economy meaning growth relative compared stock market company growth smaller expect time especially past year widespread use internet large company grown beyond usual reach come represent larger chunk gdp used verify claim one would need get hand data show contribution company represented stock market overall gnp rise value suspect would mean buffett indicator need modified using total contribution gnp stock market company instead gnp directly like note idea suggest true missing something blatantly obvious stand clear coefficient associated indicator represents relative size stock market contribution gnp gnp otherwise underlying assumption heavy hold true long period time said actual value buffett indicator significantly lower today reflect rise stock market generated gdp past year,warren buffett favorite indicator kinda wrong like incomplete past day encountered several article mentioning buffett indicator flashing red signaling dire time ahead know buffett indicator tell investor whether stock market whole overvalued relative gnp past month year signalling stock market deadly overpriced reaching significantly higher great financial crisis past month think missing one piece information make seem slightly worse seems buffett indicator simply total stock market capitalization gross national product gnp gnp quite similar gdp net property income abroad added mix add much anything change gdp interesting part market capitalization stock market usually measured wilshire full cap price index similar encompassing index link see buffett indicator currently around time writing net value meant significantly overpriced territory looking chart provided link see market significantly overpriced territory since start continuously risen coronavirus led market crash explained link line calculation drawn around one one ratio market capitalization gnp like note underlying assumption behind indicator real value market capitalization around size gdp assumption far tell hold meaning long term think mean value stock market always stay constant respect size economy could true company represented stock market growing international customer base rest economy meaning growth relative compared stock market company growth smaller expect time especially past year widespread use internet large company grown beyond usual reach come represent larger chunk gdp used verify claim one would need get hand data show contribution company represented stock market overall gnp rise value suspect would mean buffett indicator need modified using total contribution gnp stock market company instead gnp directly like note idea suggest true missing something blatantly obvious stand clear coefficient associated indicator represents relative size stock market contribution gnp gnp otherwise underlying assumption heavy hold true long period time said actual value buffett indicator significantly lower today reflect rise stock market generated gdp past year
t3_gcgpaq,"""Investors should always hold only stocks they think are the best stocks to hold at all times""","Do you agree with this sentiment?

A lot of investors (particularly buy-and-hold ones) believe ""selling at a loss"" is a sign of defeat and that loss realization is somehow detrimental to their long-term earnings, and that eventually things will go back up to break-even. 

I see ""you haven't lost anything until you sell"" posted all the time, as if somehow your unrealized loss is not a real loss, and holding is the best approach by default.

This leads investors not to fundamentally reassess the opportunity costs of what they hold, holding and hoping they can break even... someday. Only when things are to a bleak point where they are trying to salvage anything they can do they sell.

Whether a loss is realized or unrealized is irrelevant to the fact that the value today is what your value is today. Using that same monetary value, would you buy the same stock at current valuations and future predictions? If not, what the hell are you still holding for? Why not sell now and buy what you would have bought with that money, if it has a better chance of offsetting your losses long-term?",investing,investor always hold stock think best stock hold time,agree sentiment lot investor particularly buy hold one believe selling loss sign defeat loss realization somehow detrimental long term earnings eventually thing back break even see lost anything sell posted time somehow unrealized loss real loss holding best approach default lead investor fundamentally reassess opportunity cost hold holding hoping break even someday thing bleak point trying salvage anything sell whether loss realized unrealized irrelevant fact value today value today using monetary value would buy stock current valuation future prediction hell still holding sell buy would bought money better chance offsetting loss long term,investor always hold stock think best stock hold time agree sentiment lot investor particularly buy hold one believe selling loss sign defeat loss realization somehow detrimental long term earnings eventually thing back break even see lost anything sell posted time somehow unrealized loss real loss holding best approach default lead investor fundamentally reassess opportunity cost hold holding hoping break even someday thing bleak point trying salvage anything sell whether loss realized unrealized irrelevant fact value today value today using monetary value would buy stock current valuation future prediction hell still holding sell buy would bought money better chance offsetting loss long term
t3_gd2xcj,Market Movers,"Last week was mixed with positive and negative drivers for the market, but it closed with a devastating statement by Warren Buffett that will likely drag down next week's markets: ""The world has changed...and I don’t know how it’s changed and I hope it corrects itself in a reasonably prompt way"".

Here are the details:

Better than expected earnings reports from tech and airline companies. This week began with strong earnings reports by Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), United Airlines (UAL), and others, demonstrating that analyst expectations for COVID-19's impact on the markets were overstated. Markets rallied on these strong earnings reports.

Gilead (GILD) announced a successful COVID-19 treatment and is making it widely available for free. Mid-week, GILD announced a successful phase 3 trial for remdesivir for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients. Remdesivir's ability to reduce hospital stays to &lt;2 weeks for over 50% of patients. The drug gained FDA approval for emergency use and will be available to COVID-19 patients for free beginning next week. This event was another positive driver in the markets last week. 

Amazon (AMZN) profits dip due to coronavirus response, even though revenue grew by 27% since last year, disappointing investors. AMZN share price decreased by \~8% from the beginning of the weak as it posted earnings 20% lower than analyst expectations. Bezos told investors that the increase in expenses were from spending millions on developing COVID-19 tests to test all its employees and implementing enhanced cleaning techniques to prevent COVID-19 spread.

Warren Buffett sells all airline shares as he is uncertain what society will be like coming out of COVID-19. Warren Buffett announced he sold all his airline shares because he is uncertain about society after the COVID-19 crisis. Buffett stated with uncertainty, “The world has changed for the airlines. And I don’t know how it’s changed and I hope it corrects itself in a reasonably prompt way. I don’t know if Americans have now changed their habits or will change their habits because of the extended period.” This announcement may have a rippling effect on the market as many investors deem Buffett as an ""oracle,"" able to see the future of markets.

Overall, I’m optimistic about the economic recovery once stay-at-home declarations have been lifted. Protests across the country indicate unrest that is associated with lack of employment and the inability to move freely. Gilead's remdesivir brings a sense of security to economic opening as it may save many at-risk, severe patients from death.

&gt; Elon Musk tweeted a complaint about Tesla’s share price that wiped $14bn off the company’s stock market value on Friday morning.

	Tesla did not immediately confirm whether Mr Musk’s tweet had been given legal clearance, and did not respond to a question about whether the company currently has a general counsel. Tesla lost three general counsels last year, one of them quitting after only two months.


	The Tesla boss, who has 33m followers on Twitter, issued his curt verdict on his company’s shares early in the morning in California on Friday, writing: “Tesla stock price is too high imo.”

Within moments the Tesla share price started sinking, dropping 10 per cent over the course of an hour before recovering slightly. The sharp move comes in what has been a hugely volatile period for Tesla’s shares. They slumped more than 60 per cent after coronavirus hit, but then rebounded by 120 per cent.

t3_gck158,"The theory behind CapEx, Buybacks, and Dividends","I’ve seen a lot of posts recently about buyback and dividends, especially about the discussion of buybacks in the media, so I figured I’d explain some of the theory, or at least how I learned it, behind the signals they are meant to give investors when used by a company. 

Assume a company has extra cash: they have 3 options with how they can spend it depending on how they view the company, the industry they’re in, and how the market is valuing the company (technically 4 with debt repayment, but that doesn’t really drive shareholder value). 

If they think there’s a lot of growth potential they’ll use that money on CapEx, M&amp;A, R&amp;D, and other things to help the company grow. This signals they think they can grow investors money more than those investors could elsewhere. If they have more cash, or don’t see as much growth in their industry they might turn to share buybacks or dividends. 

Dividends are a signal that they think investors can create a greater return elsewhere than they can in the company (or at least are giving them the option to chose if they can since you can always reinvest) [aside, but this is why you may want to be cautious of investing in companies with high dividend payout ratios since they’re literally telling you you have better options]. 

Buybacks signal the opposite, they are the company telling the market “You aren’t seeing our value, so the best thing we can do for our investors is buy ourself since we’re so cheap”. Theoretically a company would do this only until they though they were getting a good deal. 

The commentary is then for all these companies doing large scale buybacks, “Did they actually think their best option was to invest in the company, or were they just buying back shares to inflate share prices more?” That’s a really hard to answer since the company technically knows better than us how they’re valued, but it’s also kinda shady when companies are systematically buying back shares every year at peak multiples. 

This all being said, if a company is buying back shares during a huge down market it’s a good sign they’re undervalued.

t3_gcz72i,Could The Markets Go Down With No Chance Of Recovery?,"I get the mantra of, ""If we have a recession, all you have to do if you have a diversified portfolio (like an index based ETF) is just wait about 24/36 months, you'll then have all your money back, and everything else form there will be profit again!"" 

This has essentially been true for going on a century now, and this has also been true in most real estate markets in the U.S. . For some reason, I'm starting to think that won't remain true.     I could be wrong folks, but there's something in my gut that says the future is going to be a lot worse in terms of making general market investment gains compared to what they have been over the past 50-75 years.  My reasons are based on the following, 

1. We have way too much debt.  I don't need to tell you this, but our debt to GDP is over 100% and rising fast.  With this virus and trillions in stimulus/bailout money, it's bound to get a lot worse.  Not only that, this country is saturated with person debt I.E. student loans, credit cards, and loans up the ying-yang 

2. People aren't having nearly as many kids as they used to.  In fact I'm a typical example of a male millennial that has no desire to try and raise a child. 

3. The U.S. is becoming too unstable of a society due to political problems I.E. corruption at all levels of government even at the state, city, and local levels.  

&amp;#x200B;

4. This virus just made this whole situation a lot worse, but it might have been bound to happen eventually anyway.  The virus though is very unpredictable.  Even **Warren Buffet** was saying he is pulling out of airlines.    


What I'm saying is the market could go down, and it might not recover for DECADES!  If you think that's impossible look at Japan.  Their stock market capped out in the late 1980s and to this day they have never fully recovered the losses!  The reason being is Japan is saturated with debt, and the population there hasn't increased much at all.    

&amp;#x200B;

I know what a lot of you are thinking, ""Well Japan is just a small island compared to the U.S."" I get that, but I don't think that it can't happen here.  In fact, I think it could happen within the next 10 years easily if it's not happening already.  So to make a long story short,  the mantra of: ""All you have to diversify in something like an index based fund and if you wait long it'll always go up more if it goes down as long as you can just wait about 2-5 years tops is not necessarily true!   There  are no guarantees like that.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, I'm still in the market a little bit right now.  So I'm as confused as everyone else.  Does what I'm saying here have potential merit though?

t3_gce9bg,Another global conflict is more likely than most realize,"COVID-19 will have lasting effects geopolitically. In particular, China and the East Asian pacific. The pandemic has worsened already frayed relations between China and the US. This will accelerate manufacturing outside of China, but this was going to happen anyway as China transitions to a service economy. However, the US and other countries are taking provocative actions by supporting Taiwanese independence, probably to distract their population from their own failures at home in containing the outbreak. China has made it clear that Taiwanese independence will trigger an invasion from the mainland. This is not surprising since Taiwan is essentially China's Cuba, and any hostile nation so close to the mainland is a huge national security threat for them. 

I don't rule out the possibility of U.S. formally recognizing Taiwan as an independent nation; in fact the Trump administration is so edgy that I think this is likely if he gets a second turn. If Taiwan declares independence, either by the U.S. formally recognizing them, or them declaring it themselves, mainland China will likely retaliate militarily and launch an amphibious invasion of Taiwan.

The second possibility is severe economic sanctions on China. There has been some discussion of this at the political level, but this will not ""make China behave"" as some would think, but make China more aggressive militarily. This would be similar to the US oil embargo on Japan in the 1940s. An isolate country with a worsening economy will have no choice left but to launch all out war in order to keep legitimacy.

Some people say, since China has nukes that a U.S.-China hot war is impossible. However, I do not buy that. If you look at China's nuclear capabilities, they have nowhere near the capabilities of the U.S. or the Russians. China can nuke Japan and Hawaii but I doubt they will be able to nuke much of the U.S. Whereas U.S. has complete nuclear superiority over China and can nuke them several times over.

t3_gcj53y,"Bullish until Q3, Q2 is already priced in unless its really REALLY bad, the only way we see another selloff is if Q3 earnings are negative","There have been countless meetings with the VPOTUS and Jerome Powell and how they have already mentioned that Q2 earnings is going to be BAD

personally i do not think that we will see another sell off until Q3

Q3 is the only earnings that can possibly surprise investors, everyone already knows that Q2 will probably be one of the worst earnings reports in the history of the stock market

what no one expects is earnings to be bad for Q3, everyone thinks a rebound will happen with positive earnings and well be set in an official bull market after Q3

because of this im fully bullish up until right before earnings of the big companies

i will be buying at lows for any company expecting a bounce up for everything, sure we might see some sideways trading or even small dips but i do NOT think that we will touch March lows until Q3 and that is ONLY if we have a bad Q3 earnings

think about this how you want, but all the signs are there

J. Powell literally said they have enough money to prop the market up for at minimum a year and they will do anything and everything in their power to keep the economy up

If you all have your bias' towards a bear sell off then fine everyone has their reasons

but thinking about ""where were supposed to be"" is a great indication of where the market is going.

everyone keeps thinking that we should be at ATLs right now because of unemployment and business' shutting down, but if we were gonna be there we should've been there by now

my best advice, buy at weekly lows for any company and hold and then just dollar cost average if it dips

were going to hit SPY 300 faster than everyone thinks and once we pass that threshold we might test it again as support but i really think were more than likely gonna keep going up

I can easily see SPY hit 400 over 220 by end of year

thoughts?

TL;DR - real recession will happen in Q3 when earnings are expected to rebound and be positive. Q2 earnings being ""bad"" are already priced in unless they are really REALLY bad. everyone knows theyre going to be bad. Q3 is the only thing i can thin of that will surprise investors if its a bad earnings which can start the sell off again and possibly new lows. Im bullish until Q3.

t3_gcgi1e,Japanese International Investing in Singapore,"Hi redditors!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a Japanese national, but have lived internationally as a third culture kid (TCK) in Singapore, Vietnam, Australia, Holland and now in the UK. I've done as much research as I can on investing and to what I've gathered, and what would suit my personal goals is to invest without much risk and buy one index at a time. To be more specific I can only save about 500£ per month, and intend to spend every 6 months (=3000£) on ETFs. Let me know what you guys think of this strategy, Im open for any discussion. It seems like the popular belief is to invest sooner than later if I intend a kind of couch-potato/hands-off approach to my investing.  


Secondly, I'd like to invest in Singapore's DBS Vickers to get their ETFs (they allow trading in Singapore, Canada (not taxed unlike USA), Hong Kong and US (doubt I'll touch that stock market since not sure about being taxed)), which is one of the few ways I can as a Japanese National (restrictions apply in Internaxx (Luxembourg), Swissquote (Switzerland) and Saxo Capital Markets and Interactive Brokers (didn't like reviews on their customer service)). Does anyone know anything more specifically about being an expat and dealing with offshore brokerage? DBS trading commission is 28S$ and hence my reason to save up 3000£ (= 5308.60S$ which means I lose like 0.5% per trade), is this still smart? Any thoughts? Really just a beginner here, I'm just a bit of a book vacuum and may have overinformed myself, would be nice to hear any real-world experiences. Even in general with offshore brokerage and investing in small amounts every half year.

t3_gc7scb,Tanker stocks STNG vs NAT and Clean vs Crude,"
A lot of you are going to miss the boat on NAT (get it?). Here’s why:

Rates for shipping CLEAN product (refined gasoline, naphtha, jet fuel) are showing to be way more stable and are currently, insanely high vs DIRTY (crude oil) shipping rates. We are talking around 10x/day.

What does this mean? Crude oil shipping rates are still very high comparatively to last year, but are far below what clean rates are as of right now. 

Also, the fundamentals of NAT vs other tanker stocks just suck. There are far better options in the tanker world that will hold value better long term. NAT is among your worst options. 

The clean tanker stock that I think is poised to rally hard is $STNG. They have 42 LR2 ships in their fleet who are exposed to the most insane rates of all of the ship types currently. Their fleet is also modern and new. Refined products seemed to have backed up harder than crude meaning there is more need for storage on the water and shipment to terminal locations. It has dipped enough in the past week to make it a hell of a buy just before their earnings on 5/6. Q1 will be solid, but Q2 guidance should be
crazy appetizing as they are hopefully locking in these LR2 rates now.

t3_gc1lkc,Does The Fed cutting interest rates cut both ways?,"So I had a little bit of an aha moment looking back at previous crashes, and reading news articles from 2008 and 2009. This may have been obvious to most of you guys, but it wasn't immediately to me.

So The Fed is cutting interest rates and doing QE to encourage lending and trying to maintain liquidity in the credit market. This drives down the yeilds on basically everything. There was been a pretty consistent downward trend in 10Y Treasuries since 2001 (maybe even earlier?).

10Y Treasuries had 5% yields when folks were experiencing the 2008 crash. Am I right in assuming that investors back then may have been more likely to rebalance their portfolios into safer assets because yields were still semi attractive, over just holding cash or equities? Would that temper volatility at all?

In low yeild environments are people encouraged to just switch back and forth between equities and cash, trying to time the markets?

Major airlines are going for 1/3 of that they were usually going for.  UAL is going for $26.00 a share when it was going for $75 just a few months ago.

Let's say I have $30,000 to invest.  I put $10,000 into 3 different airlines:

10k in UAL, 10k in LUV, 10k in Delta.

Worst case scenerio 2 airlines go bk, but 1 goes back to it's original price.  That means I will totally break even and not lose anything.  (I can't see all 3 major US airlines going BK).  If anything, the remaining ones will eat up the other ones market share.

Medium case scenerio:  1 airline goes BK, the other 2 go back to their normal price.  In that case I made a decent profit.

Best case scenario: No airline goes BK, and all 3 return to their normal price, and I just tippled my investment.

t3_gcawmd,Thoughts on Equity Valuations and Why They Should Be Higher,"These are two primary reasons why I believe market P/E ratios have to be higher today than in the past. Comparing the P/E ratio of today and decades of the past is almost like comparing apples and oranges for the following reasons:

(1) **Free Put Option** is ignored by P/E ratios. When you buy the S&amp;P 500, you’re also getting an embedded put option provided by the Fed and US Treasury. If market conditions get worse, these entities will support risk assets through liquidity (Fed) and deficit spending (Treasury). This idea about the free put option has been around since 2009-2010, but it has been further qualified with recent actions. The repo market problems we saw in 2019 showed the Fed will step in even when stocks are at all-time highs! This put option has only increased in value since the GFC b/c the magnitude and frequency of support is very high. This put option won’t always exist, but should as long as fiat currency is accepted, the USD is the world reserve currency and the Fed’s measures of inflation don’t go meaningfully above 2.5% to 3%.

(2) **Free Cash Flow and Low LT Rates – Tech Wins**. The foundation of asset valuation is the value of an asset is the present value of its future cash flows. When discounting future cash flows, the US 10-year has gone from 2-3% in recent years to 0.61% which increases the PV. You all know that. What a lot of people haven’t picked up on yet is free cash flow profiles differ substantially across industries and companies. If a company doesn’t generate much FCF, their firm valuation does not benefit from low long-term rates as much. Compare and contrast the cash flow statements of Exxon and Visa. Visa’s cash flow generation is nothing short of exceptional, and Exxon’s is poor. A lot of tech generates a ton of FCF and their P/E and EV/EBITDA valuations are very high, but I’d argue those aren’t really the best methods of valuing them because it doesn’t credit them for their best attributes, which is crazy cash flow generation. Discounted Cash Flow is the purest form of asset valuation.

Technology has become a very large part of the market today. These tech behemoths (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, FB, V) generate crazy amounts of cash. Their cash flow statements are beautiful. A P/E ratio reflects accounting earnings, and does not measure true free cash flow which is the purest form of asset valuation. There may be a better example, but in 2019 XOM had $10.6B of Net Income and $5.3B of Free Cash Flow (Cash from Operations minus Capex). In 2018, V had $10.8B of Net Income (same as XOM in 2019) but had $12.2B of Free Cash Flow. There is a big difference and cash is king.

Question: The German 10-year Bund is -0.59%, so why aren’t European equities higher? Look at the composition of the European stock indexes – can you name any great European tech company? Maybe SAP? Dassault Systemes is basically the most US-like tech company in Europe and it stock has been great, but there is basically nothing else. Europe does have great pharma companies that generate cash flow but they all have very little growth. Europe has hardly any free cash flow growth and that is what low long-term rates love.

\#1. Free Cash Flow matters a lot more than EPS. #2. Growth in tech w/in the S&amp;P 500 has led to more cash flow generation than we’ve seen historically, so P/E should be higher. #3. Low interest rates benefit FCF generation through DCF models. Bottom line, traditional equity valuations are higher b/c of these market realities.",investing,thought equity valuation higher,two primary reason believe market ratio higher today past comparing ratio today decade past almost like comparing apple orange following reason free put option ignored ratio buy also getting embedded put option provided fed treasury market condition get worse entity support risk asset liquidity fed deficit spending treasury idea free put option around since qualified recent action repo market problem saw showed fed step even stock time high put option increased value since gfc magnitude frequency support high put option always exist long fiat currency accepted usd world reserve currency fed measure inflation meaningfully free cash flow low rate tech win foundation asset valuation value asset present value future cash flow discounting future cash flow year gone recent year increase know lot people picked yet free cash flow profile differ substantially across industry company company generate much fcf firm valuation benefit low long term rate much compare contrast cash flow statement exxon visa visa cash flow generation nothing short exceptional exxon poor lot tech generates ton fcf ebitda valuation high argue really best method valuing credit best attribute crazy cash flow generation discounted cash flow purest form asset valuation technology become large part market today tech behemoth aapl msft googl generate crazy amount cash cash flow statement beautiful ratio reflects accounting earnings measure true free cash flow purest form asset valuation may better example xom net income free cash flow cash operation minus capex net income xom free cash flow big difference cash king question german year bund european equity higher look composition european stock index name great european tech company maybe sap dassault systemes basically like tech company europe stock great basically nothing else europe great pharma company generate cash flow little growth europe hardly free cash flow growth low long term rate love free cash flow matter lot eps growth tech led cash flow generation seen historically higher low interest rate benefit fcf generation dcf model bottom line traditional equity valuation higher market reality,thought equity valuation higher two primary reason believe market ratio higher today past comparing ratio today decade past almost like comparing apple orange following reason free put option ignored ratio buy also getting embedded put option provided fed treasury market condition get worse entity support risk asset liquidity fed deficit spending treasury idea free put option around since qualified recent action repo market problem saw showed fed step even stock time high put option increased value since gfc magnitude frequency support high put option always exist long fiat currency accepted usd world reserve currency fed measure inflation meaningfully free cash flow low rate tech win foundation asset valuation value asset present value future cash flow discounting future cash flow year gone recent year increase know lot people picked yet free cash flow profile differ substantially across industry company company generate much fcf firm valuation benefit low long term rate much compare contrast cash flow statement exxon visa visa cash flow generation nothing short exceptional exxon poor lot tech generates ton fcf ebitda valuation high argue really best method valuing credit best attribute crazy cash flow generation discounted cash flow purest form asset valuation technology become large part market today tech behemoth aapl msft googl generate crazy amount cash cash flow statement beautiful ratio reflects accounting earnings measure true free cash flow purest form asset valuation may better example xom net income free cash flow cash operation minus capex net income xom free cash flow big difference cash king question german year bund european equity higher look composition european stock index name great european tech company maybe sap dassault systemes basically like tech company europe stock great basically nothing else europe great pharma company generate cash flow little growth europe hardly free cash flow growth low long term rate love free cash flow matter lot eps growth tech led cash flow generation seen historically higher low interest rate benefit fcf generation dcf model bottom line traditional equity valuation higher market reality

With AMD breathing down their back, Intel is lowering prices on their server chips lowering profit margins which won't be coming back anytime soon: https://www.anandtech.com/show/15405/intel-cuts-xeon-prices

Intel is constantly talking about how they're going to be shipping 7nm in 2021 when they have failed to get their 10nm process working for almost 4 years now past its original expected release date. It's clear Intel's process has stagnated, and their choice to stick with manufacturing their own CPUs has now turned from advantage to disadvantage as it's competitors are able to focus on design while leaving the process improvements to TSMC: https://www.pcworld.com/article/3394398/intel-commits-to-shipping-7nm-chips-by-2021-an-aggressive-change-of-pace.html

I'll be honest in saying that I'm probably somewhat biased here in that I don't trust business CEOs to know how to run a tech company properly. As an engineer, I know how important it is that you actually understand your products and the engineering that goes into CPU design, and so I prefer when the CEO actually has that capability.

Intel hasn't been run by an engineer for quite some time at this point. Just look at Intel's current CEO Bob Swan. He is literally the definition of the ""MBA business type executive"". We compare that to companies like AMD and Nvidia, which are both headed by strong technically minded engineers and the differences in management are like night and day.

On the flip side, clear beneficiaries of the current upheaval are doing well. 

So while markets are not moving on real-time economic fundamentals, they are moving on reasonable judgements of fundamentals going forward

The Fed, for instance, is committed to purchasing hundreds of billions of dollars of municipal bonds at favorable rates, which will mean that cash-strapped state governments should be able to retain teachers and policemen and programs

The Fed also is about to lend another $500 billion to Main Street businesses, which is coming too late to avoid the pain of the last month but will still matter greatly to the ability of companies to move forward and eventually rehire. The most visible effect of the money in motion now is the stock market, but that will be not the sole beneficiary as more Fed money flows to states and Main Street.

t3_gbq1rx,Best method of long term investing on margin?,"Hey all, 

I've been interested in investing on margin for awhile. My thought process has mainly been, I should get into real estate because I see everyone making tons of money on it, mainly due to leverage. But then it seems like a lot of work and there's the opportunity cost of the down payment that could be in the market and REITs could basically be the same. So I say well really what I want I think is to just make money off loans to make more money. 

Anyway I'm dabbling in trading a little extra in VTI on margin. Low enough that I shouldn't get margin called, but high enough to hopefully increase my return in the long run a bit.

Looking around for best places and the best I've found is M1 finance with 2% if I get M1 plus for $125 a year. Only other similar ones were interactive brokers. I'm hoping to do like &lt;10% (probably &lt;5% to start) of my NW.

I think the fall were starting to see is the money that had no where to go (which in previous recessions people just sat on, but now that everything including gambling on stocks is more accessible there is a ton of free cash in the market right now) currently propping up this bull run that doesn't make sense is going to exit back into brick and mortar as the economy re opens. Now this goes either way depending on how it goes.

If it goes well we see a small climb in the first month on optimism, then an exit as money circulates in the actual economy again, and we see a return to a ""new normal"" low level. Bear view

If it doesn't go well money re enters we see another massive bull run followed by another crash. Bull view, then we cycle back into trying to reopen again.

I think the stock downturn today is mere facade with worries that this is not a ""cure"" or that the results were not the magic-bullet. I disagree.

That's a very important economic and healthcare space improvement. There was also a trend towards SS with overall survival and likely would have been met in larger numbers. With this all in mind and my own medical background, it appears obvious this is a good investment at least until the phase III publication.

This is the time to ride this wave. If the phase III results are published and lacking (doubt it) or a vaccine develops before the phase III publication, then jump ship. Gilead is the stock to hold for the next few months.

t3_gc066k,Effect of leverage,"hi, first of all I don't know a lot about investing, but I was thinking on investing on a x4 leveraged product that I think will perform well.

So I know that leverage amplifies both profit and loss but does it have an effect on a daily basis or only when I sell.

For example:
if I buy a 100$ stock at a 4:1 leverage and it goes up by 10% on day one then it becomes 140$ I guess.
Then on day two it goes down by 20% so the 140$ become 60$ because of the 4:1 ratio
Does it work that way?

or is it so that if I buy at 100$ and after going up and down after a month it's gone up by 50% so at 4:1 leverage it's a 200$ increase?

what I mean is : does the leverage only take effect at the time of selling?

I don't know if I managed to express my question clearly, thanks in advance",investing,effect leverage, first know lot investing thinking investing leveraged product think perform well know leverage amplifies profit loss effect daily basis sell example buy stock leverage day one becomes guess day two become ratio work way buy going month gone leverage increase mean leverage take effect time selling know managed express question clearly thanks advance,effect leverage  first know lot investing thinking investing leveraged product think perform well know leverage amplifies profit loss effect daily basis sell example buy stock leverage day one becomes guess day two become ratio work way buy going month gone leverage increase mean leverage take effect time selling know managed express question clearly thanks advance
t3_gbmg4t,New trader seeking advice. I took the time to write down my strategy. Please be harsh.,"I've been trading for about 3 months now, and really feel like I've found my calling.  I want to trade full time as a career eventually when I've built up enough capital.  
I've done a lot of due diligence and self-educating, and have formed some semblance of a strategy.  I've written down a list of rules that should never be broken, and that is the basis of my strategy.  I would love some feedback and advice from professionals.  I apologise in advance if I fail to use the proper terminology, or if I've posted in the wrong spot.  

1. Watch any stock with RSI 30 or less which is below both SMA20 &amp; SMA90.

2. Analyze the MACD to determine the momentum of a trend and the chance of reversal

3. Read the news to determine the stock isn't dead(filing for bankruptcy, about to be delisted, about to split, major scandal)

4. Take a position if the majority of analysts say to buy or hold.

5. Move into positions with an initial buy worth 0.5% of total portfolio value.
	
6. Aim for gains between 8-10% above avg price.  Once a stock price reaches 5% increase start to Set &amp; regularly maintain Stop Loss Sells to protect profits.

7. The maximum value of any position should not exceed 2% of your portfolios total value

8. First Double Down triggered @ 10% loss.  Stop Loss Sell @ 7% increase.  100+90=190÷2=95(avg price).  7% increase from 90 is 96.3
	
9. Second Double Down triggered @ 20% loss from first Double Down. Stop Loss Sell @ 17% increase. 100+90+72+72=334÷4=83.5(avg price).  17% increase from 72 is  84.2.
	
10. Final sell at a loss should be executed after 5% loss from second Double Down.

11. Dont touch anything that trades at a volume of less than 3 million.

12. Try to avoid holding positions over the weekend.  Even if you have to take a smaller gain or a shallow loss(1-3%) to get out before market hours on Friday, it is generally advantageous to do so.  (This rule is likely due to my own anxieties.  I'm happier when I have less money on the line during the weekend.  A lot of news can drop in that 2 day span between trading days.)

I've tried to set up these rules such that one follows the other (I wont be wasting my time reading news about the stock if it's trading above 30 RSI).  I am extremely conservative because I don't have a lot of capital and I desperately try to protect the small bit I do have(my initial investment was $500, and likely won't add more capital until after I've started working my regular job again).  I trade almost exclusively stocks listed on the NYSE, NASDAQ, or S&amp;P 500.  Sometimes I trade crypto, but only with extremely good indicators, as the extreme volatility scares me a little.  I stay the fuck away from options and futures.  I'm interested in the technicals of Forex, and am open to trading put options after I've sufficiently grown my account.

Please be as harsh as you can with your criticism without being unfair.  There is no room for feelings in this game, I know that.  I am trying to improve.

t3_gbscwg,Why buy stocks of exchanges?,"Hi!

I'm a new investor who decided to jump into the market a couple of days before this year's low, and I have invested just under £1000 in my portfolio in three blue chip companies. Anyway, I was just wondering what the point was in being able to buy shares of the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and NASDAQ (NDAQ) themselves. It kinda doesn't make sense to me... if buying a stock means owning a share of a company, what do you own with the exchanges themselves and what is the incentive to buy? Wouldn't they just go up indefinitely and defeat the point of a Vanguard ETF unless you wanted the S&amp;P, FTSE or general regions?

t3_gbbs8f,How to Value Stock in a Time of COVID-19 (ELI5 Edition),"So, there have a raging debate recently between bulls and bear.

I would like to offer my explanation in regard to this. Since this is r/investing , i assume most of you guys have basic understanding in regard to FCF Valuation. But in case you don't know, it is pretty popular subject if you want to go deep down into fundamental investing. Some popular resources i would like to recommend is [Aswath Damodaran](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/), [Valuation by McKinsey](https://www.amazon.com/Valuation-Measuring-Managing-Value-Companies/dp/0470424656). Basically in FCF Valuation, you make an estimation in regard of future cash flow a company can generate in the future and discount it to the present time to arrive at the value of the business right now.

Since this is ELI5, i will not go into too much details. This is heavily dumbed down scenario, but i think it is enough to give you understanding.

Let's assume a **hypothetical company**. It is a good business with no debt, it has no risk of bankcruptcy in the near future.

Revenue = $1.000.000

Variable cost = 40% (this is the cost that incurred everytime you make a sale. Example : sales commision, product cost, delivery, etc.)

Fixed sot = $400.000 (this is the cost that incurred whether you make a sales or not. Example = Rent expense, salary, fixed assets depreciation, etc).

Net income = $200.000

The Value of the business is $2.000.000 (you can assume this is the market price, if someone actually want to buy the company).

For simplicity sake, we assume the net income is fully on cash-basis, so the net income also represent the free cash flow for the business. 

Assume that because of COVID-19, the revenue in 2020 will be down by as much as 50% and in 2021 will be down by 25%. It will go back to normal in 2022, so the terminal value or going forward it will go back to pre-covid value of $2.000.000

 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |
:--|:--:|:--:|--: |
Revenue | 500,000 | 750,000 | - |
Variable Cost| -200,000 | - 300,000 | - |
Gross Margin| 300,000 | 450,000 | - |
Fixed cost | -400,000 | -400,000 | - |
Net Income | -100,000 | 50,000 | - |
Terminal Value | - | - | 2,000,000 |
Discount factor* | 0.9090 | 0.8264 | 0.7513 |
Present Value | -90,909 | 41,332 | 1,502,629 |

*I use 10% Cost of capital. It is calculated simply by dividing 1/cost of capital^n . In this case 1/10%. This is pretty high as you might see, [a lot of business has lower cost of capital](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar). And lower cost of capital will result in higher present value.

If we sum all the present value (Net income/terminal value discounted into the present), it will arrive at $1,453,042, compared to previous value of $2,000,000. A 27% decrease in value, significant but arguably much more modest than many people would imagine.

Of course this is just hypothetical. But i would like to believe that my assumption is quite conservative. Like with the 10% cost of capital (even after the fed slash rate), or long U-shaped recovery. But if you try the FCF Valuation (the actual one, not this dumbed down version), you will see that the value will not go down as far as some bears like to believe. 

==========
**What we can take from this.**

Yes, time is bad and many good business will record very low or in fact negatives income this year. But this is not as doom and gloom as many people wanted to believe.

We see company like Adidas, Disney, Yum Brands penalized quite a bit because COVID, around the range of 25%-40%, depending on the timeline you are looking at, which is actually quite fair in regards to their future performances.

I knew at this point people have enough with priced-in, but yeah, the current price did in fact have priced in the COVID issue in their prices.

Just because a lot of unemployment and low revenue this year doesn't mean the value of the business will go down by as much as 50% or even lower. That's not how it works in regards to Value of a Business. 

Imagine if you have a good family business. This year will be rough, but you and your family have enough to keep everything a float. Some random investor comes in and said ""whew, bad times eh? Can i buy your business for 40% of its market price?""

If i were him, i will show them the exit door right away. Why would i sell it if i expect the business will recover in 2 years.

But actually there is a lot of stock right now facing this condition. Their stock are heavily penalized, and it is your job to find them and if you right, reaping the capital gain from them.

In regards to myself, two weeks ago I'm at 25% stock, 75% cash. But last weeks i decide to shift gear and move to 75% stock and 25% cash (I have to thanks [Howard Marks](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/howard-marks-memos) for this). I left 25% just in case that I am wrong and market will drive even lower than this.",investing,value stock time covid eli edition,raging debate recently bull bear would like offer explanation regard

t3_gbjltk,"People who are looking for ""cheap"" stocks might consider IBM. They trade at 12x earnings, pay a ~5% dividend, and just acquired redhat recently","IBM has had basically flat (slight decline) revenues and profits for ~5 years, which is not quite the Tech stock headline we are used to seeing.  Market cap is 108bn today, revenues of 77bn in 2019, and earnings of 9.4bn. 

I feel they are integrated into so many business / government operations, that they will be reasonably well positioned during the covid crisis to continue to make money.  It is true that IBM will not be able to sell as many new services while its clients cost cut &amp; pause new investing. However IBM is a mature business - clients cannot easily switch products - and they will continue to earn from those.  

They are focused improving their hybrid cloud offerings and acquired redhat in July 2019 for 34bn, which at the time had growing earnings (3bn per year most recently), and growing revenues. Maybe IBM will screw up this trend, but hopefully not. Cloud provides some upside potential.

Even though we see some slight declines in earnings/revenues, IBM is still massively profitable, and I believe can eventually regain their footing through investment in R&amp;D or acquisition.  Having a lot of cash coming in is huge, because they can afford to make investments that many smaller contracting companies cannot.

IBM's global technology services (consulting, build, design, run) has been declining (9% YoY), which accounts for 60% of their revenue. However IBM is pretty well diversified in offerings, and will likely see other bets begin to offset this. Cloud is about 30% of their business and is growing at a 20% YoY rate.

IBM pays ~5.7Bn out in dividends of it's 9.7bn in earnings, so dividend is sustainable. I think for the price, IBM is a bargain.  It's not a trendy company, but it makes money and will continue to do so.

Any time the international goes up the SP500 is going up as well...

Inputting 40k which is roughly 20% of my total funds, the SP500 would have returned $238.4k since 1997 while VTIAX (Vanguard Total International Stock Index Admiral) Only returned $100k....

Even in 2017 when it did well.. SP500 performed the same margins if not better.

Is the reason for investing part of our stock in International just because of the chance International will do better one day?  Or is it kind of like a safety net if the US market goes to shit then we still have something invested in International?

t3_gbzgi1,There is a nuance to this...A primer on not being absolutely unequipped,"Hi All!

Honestly, I have no idea what I was thinking subbing to all of the major investing threads on Reddit. Now that I am more aware of what the landscape is, I would like to help. Honestly, no snarky shit.

It's not going to be a panacea, and this isn't going to immediately, read...immediately, help with your confusion. 

Ok, so, I get it, market is at recent lows and now you want to jump in. Smart. Well played...oh wait, this doesn't look like a 001 econ class chart, etc etc etc. I'm not here to beat you down. You were right to believe now is the time to buy, but all of the  crazy confusion can be a bit well, confusing. Also, if you feel like it, cross post this to whatever Tatooine-esque investing sub you like. It will save me some trouble.

1. Do not start investing in the hopes for short term gain on the backbone of a knowledge base that's as flimsy as jello. Seriously. I put this #1 because it should be the most over pronounced the few of us that are well versed should be repeating at all times, regardless of it not getting all the sexy upvotes of a market slander / confusion post...why?
2. Most people that make short term profits in this are lucky, or have extensive education, training, professional experience watching economic activity. Seriously. This is why I am putting this second. Joe regular, having whatever non-business / economics background is not on the same ground that people with a well versed background. On the internet, you're not going to be able to tell people apart immediately, and ""free"" advice is everywhere.
3. If you don't fall into #1 or #2, go long always. Invest in high quality firms with strong financials. Names you know. Make a buy, and sit on it forever or until you want to cash out. OR, pay a professional. There generally isn't a comfortable middle ground (sure, exceptions). Don't do this when the economy isn't on the news every night...do do this, if you can, when the economy is the forefront. Good news hardly makes nightly news, bad news always does. If your gut tells you that times are tough, but you have extra, that's when you should look into the bigger names...but this won't always work...why...
4. If you cannot lose as much as you put in, don't. Just don't. Even for the best of us this is a well placed bet. There is no guarantee. Stop. Invest in a 401k with a strong fiduciary. A well managed mutual fund. Please help yourself and do not start using an app that doesn't base itself on constant deposits and steady investment. Investing is good, within reason. Bad investing is essentially gambling addiction. Call the same number, talk to someone. There are prominent media figures right now, from fairly popular sports networks, just making click money on being bad at this. Those people can afford to loose money, a lot of people cannot. If you cannot, go long, go diversified, pay someone.
5. I cannot overstate how much experience matters. I was going to wrap this up, but it had to be said. If you failed out of math, economics, etc...just stop. Pay someone. Being able to watch a trend in real time isn't for everyone. Knowing economic indicators, geopolitics, and cyclical business schedules matters. In the short-term it matters a lot. I make money swing trading market trends, on top of playing standard long positions. I can do that because I can absorb a variety of information and know what to do with it. Seriously, 3 media inputs and flat numbers. I cannot overstate how much most people should make safe bets long.

And that's that, for now. I may cross-post on my own, but have just wanted to get that out.

Now what confuses me is that it went down today. Was this purely driven by the market?? This is the way I see it: They had equivalent EPS from Q1 2019 to now this Q1 2020. Not only did they meet/beat earnings, but these weren’t adjusted earnings from the virus. BLDR has maintained and grown from quarters before the virus. So if the stock was at $28 before the crash, and is now at $17, with it beating earnings and increasing sales from the numbers posted BEFORE the virus, why is the value not $28 or higher. Essentially this earnings showed that they haven’t missed a beat since the virus started. The only counter I could possibly think of is anticipation of next quarters results being low due to real estate lending companies not funding new projects, thus making the supply for BLDR’s goods decrease. I have a hard time believing that the day after a 21% earnings beat, people are already trading in anticipation of the next quarters earnings. And I don’t want to hear “well the 50% gain over this last week is the earnings being priced in” the reason this doesn’t work for me is as I mentioned above.

t3_gac5zf,/R/Investing has thrown its own advice out the window and is behaving incredibly irrational right now.,"I have browsed this sub for the better part of the last decade and picked up a lot of useful tips and information. The last few weeks - it seems like it has become the norm to toss best practices of investing out the window.


I learned the following on here: 

You can not time the markets. It is impossible. The market is irrational. Keep your money in and keep investing. Time is your friend. The market will go up over long periods of time.

And now in 2020 I am seeing the following advice being pushed:

I know better than the markets. The markets will drop. I can surely time this. It’s not me that’s wrong it’s the market. The market is not responding correctly to bad news.

I am even seeing people over emphasize negative news stories about the virus or the economy. It seems there is a growing resentment from people holding cash that may have missed catching a falling knife - which we always knew to be incredibly difficult.

The fact of the matter is we don’t know how the market will behave. For us average investors it is best to keep putting money in and holding or dollar cost averaging.

t3_fz8yy8,"Algos move the market in the short term, not retail/institutional/pension funds","My title of my post is the statement I stuck too from the very moment this selloff started. I've stayed consistent with this belief the entire time, whether we go up or down. If you just wanted any more proof, take a look at the Twitter link, as an additional piece of evidence. It's the same case in the recent up moves (the futures are contributing to the majority of the recent up move). 

https://mobile.twitter.com/bespokeinvest/status/1248368169091239937

Retail, institutional investors, pension funds, etc. - they don't trade overnight futures. However you know who does? Stat arb algos as well as option trading firms/hedge funds/prop trading firms/bank risk-mitigation algos. For example if a hedge fund was put into a dicey risk situation, they turn on these algos to offload risk overnight. If they can't sell credit risk, they have to do it elsewhere like in ES futures. If an option market maker is short gamma and realizes oh crap, this is gonna cause me to be super long tomorrow with this move in ES, I've gotta hedge and turn on my overnight algo to sell first so I get less long deltas overnight. 

So when you guys want to ask ""who in the world is even selling"" as we sold off and now ""who in the world is even buying"" as we go up, it's the algos. You are right, not many actual people are buying these days. It's the algos, and when I say algos, I mean the risk/liquidity algos.

Do you want to know why the algos are buying now? It's simple. Jerome Powell said he's buying credit ETFs. If you are a market maker, you have to sell these ETFs to them. Now you have to find a beta hedge. What's the best way to find that beta hedge? Buy ES futures. This then causes SPY to open higher. Now, if your algo was fast enough, you could have front ran the FED by buying HYG and JNK (this is why their NAV is trading at a massive premium), but if you weren't, well you get desperate as you get picked off from being short credit, so now you have to buy ES, SPY, and anything else you can. You might have to then buy SPX/SPY puts with it since you then have to protect your now new ES/SPY longs (which you didn't actually want to buy but were ""forced"" to buy),, which is why VIX hasn't dropped that much relative to how much SPY has gone up. It's all an algorithmically driven market. 

This is why the entire market, on BOTH the down move and the now up move, has decoupled from the economy. So no, you guys may think people are FOMOing in. That's not true. Most investors aren't FOMOing in right now. The algos have just gone out of control on both the down and up moves and it's all technical. 

Correlation (with other assets like credit and bonds), positioning (short squeeze and forced liquidations), option gamma (short gamma makes moves bigger), and short term stat arb strategies dominate the market short term. Retail and even big firms like Blackrock or Berkshire do not. Fundamentals win out long term. It may be months for SPY, and it is years for individual companies. No short term movement is ever controlled for by actual people wanting to put on a position. 

As I said a month ago when we were selling off, if Citadel and Renaissance Technologies wanted to hold up the entire market for a day, they easily could. They may not want to if it's not in their favor, but they easily could. Two firms. That's enough. That about sums up this market. (EDIT: this part may have been extremely confusing due to my bad wording, but if you read some of the posts below with like me, MasterCookSwag, and ArseneWankerer, I try to clear up my meaning)

Another interesting and true fact? If options trading was ELIMINATED, the market would NEVER have sold off to 220 and it would have never skyrocketed back to almost 280 now. You may ask it's the same fundamentals right? Yes it is, the fundamentals of the economy and virus are the same, but elimiate options, and actually the entire market changes.

Finally, to add one more thing, if this wasn't clear, there needs to be a catalyst for the first wave of selling and buying, but everything after that is purely technical. For example, the catalysts would have been the virus and the oil shock in the wave of selling. The catalyst would have been the Fed in the wave of buying. However, the catalyst in itself shouldn't have produced a very large move. For example, imagine we go from 290 -&gt; 270 as an example. The catalyst, if only traded by itself, should have moved it from 290 -&gt; 285. However, the algos, with all the technical details I described above, then moves it from 285 -&gt; 270. This is what I call ""forced selling"" or ""fake selling,"" and I've alluded to this in my other posts. There is also ""fake buying"" in the reverse. However, ""fake selling"" is usually more powerful because on average people leverage up to be more bullish than bearish in an average market environment. So yes, the initial catalyst is important, but it's not the reason for the majority of short term moves. 

I worked in the industry so I know this. You can call it a dirty secret, but hopefully if you see some actual statistics (see the above link on Twitter), you'll understand too. Fundamentals eventually will win longer term, but you know that saying about how the market can stay irrational before you stay solvent, well that's literally true because the market is algo driven. And as we progress into a state of better technology and even more options volume (think about how many people just recently started trading options) and other assets, this will be more and more true. One of these days, which could be like in 20+ years,  if some black swan catalyst happens in conjunction with all of these technical factors I mentioned, you literally can see a 20% triple circuit breaker day immediately and like 90%+ of that drop would be all technical.

I'll try to answer any questions to the best of my ability.

EDIT: So for the people who are pointing out I don't understand what a MM is, let's do a easier example with NFL betting lines. Vegas acts like a MM in this regard.  When an NFL line closes, is it 50/50 on both sides of the line?  Nope.  Vegas is still subject to risk.  That's why sometimes they win or lose a lot of money depending on the outcome of an event, even though they are a ""MM"" too.  Yes, Vegas will adjust a line based on some order flow, but it has their OWN MODELS TOO to determine what is fair, so they will adjust accordingly to the toxicity of the order flow. They will not just completely change their line so much so simply based pure order flow to keep on capturing 50/50.  If you really think an options MM for example goes home every night flat every Greek, you are kidding yourself.  

The point I was making above is a firm such as Citadel does so much volume that they have a huge impact on the market, whereas if you take them out of the market for say a month, the entire market microstructure changes in options and equities.  Notice in my original post, I clearly said that these firms may not actually want to do this in their favor, but I am using them as an example saying they do so much volume they can IF they wanted to (in options you are more likely to do so than equities). I was emphasizing this point to show you guys how algos play such a large role in the market. It's similar to Vegas when they act as a MM to betting lines.  They control the betting line at the end of the day.  They aren't always 50/50 on both sides with no risk.  Of course, Citadel and SIG in options will adjust their vol curves based on some order flow, but at the end of the day, they control most of the options vol pricing, which indirectly also affects equities in a big way when we have massive short gamma moves.

Similarily, apply it to sports betting.  Let's say we shut down Vegas for a month and let only DraftKings price all the betting lines.  I bet you the lines would be different and the volume would be different.  Would they be completely different (like a -3 to a +3 line)?  No, it wouldn't be that extreme, but it would be different and volume would be different and reaction to order flow would be different. Just think about it like this and apply it to trading.

EDIT2: this was also my post like ~3 weeks ago when we were like ~230.  Too bad r/investing deleted my context of my post (since it relates to a lot of what I said below), but you can still see my title and my comments, so you know what I was calling.  Yea sure, you can say I got lucky, but I wasn't wrong.

https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fjtkzh/we_are_very_close_to_the_bottom/

Addressing the above link, it's the type of logic that I am using in my below posts to probabilistically call bottoms like this.  I'm never 100% sure (it's impossible to even be like 70%+ sure imo), but if you put some of this together (like when does the forced selling for the risk/liquidty algos stop?), you can actually call bottoms a bit easier than just winging it 50/50.  Notice that this also coincided with March options expirations, as I mention, options are a big part.  It also conincided with Jay Powell saying he's going to ""alleviate the risks"" (this is the forced selling from algos risk) he sees in the repo and now credit market.

EDIT3: u/brokegambler posted this, if you want a real professional talking about it

EDIT4: ok last edit but https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pinningthestrike.asp is just a quick example of one phenomenon that happens due to options and market makers.  There's not going to be many articles you can find online on about what I'm talking about, but this pinning the strike phenomenon is a well-observed effect that's actually writen about of what market makers can do in terms of controlling price action due to their risk.  Interestingly, what we have in our case the last month is the opposite of this in which rather than strikes getting pinned, strikes get blown through to cause the huge moves (since we've been in short gamma the last month).  The article isn't super detailed, but can give you a general idea of one effect.

EDIT5: sorry I'll add one last edit...I do realize maybe my wording was not the greatest in my post, and after reading it again, it does sound a bit ""forceful"" at times, so I apologize for that.

t3_fhrfqo,"Coronavirus Megathread: Resources, discussion, and your questions","Given the number of requests we've had to post a megathread along with the volume of similar threads being submitted, we're consolidating future general discussion on this topic here.

**We will continue to make updates to this post.**

# Stimulus checks (Minor updates April 15th)

Quick update:

The IRS has a portal where non-filers can enter their payment information to get a stimulus check, for filers to check payment status, confirm their payment type, and enter direct deposit information:

**https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments**

**Note that the IRS is only updating payments status once per day. Don't wreck yourself checking every five minutes.**

---

The CARES Act authorizing relief/stimulus payments directly to individuals has been passed into law.

For non-dependent individuals, you are entitled to $1,200 if your AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) is below $75,000. For married couples filing jointly, it is $2,400 if your joint AGI is below $150,000. Taxpayers with dependent qualifying children will receive $500 per qualifying child (16 or younger, the rules are based on the child tax credit).

If your AGI is above the income threshold of $75,000 or $150,000, you will be entitled $5 less for every additional $100 of income above that threshold until the amount is fully phased out. For example, if you are single and without kids, the potential maximum amount of $1,200 is completely phased out once your income hits $99,000. If you are married with two young children then the maximum payment of $3,400 is completely phased out once your joint income hits $218,000.

Prior years' tax returns are being used to calculate each person's stimulus payment. If you filed your 2019 tax return already, that will be used. If not, then your 2018 tax return will be used. If you have not filed taxes for 2018 or 2019, you should do so as soon as possible to secure your eligibility for a prompt payment. Finally, if your 2020 income and status would allow you to receive you a larger payment, you will have to wait until you file in 2021 for the 2020 tax year, and you will receive the difference as a credit on your 2020 tax return.

Basically, you will get to keep the payment you receive and if you receive a smaller payment than your 2020 income would allow, you'll get a credit when you file your 2020 taxes.

**How will I get paid?**

If you received your tax refund by direct deposit into a single bank account, your relief payment will be deposited to the same account. If you did not receive your refund by direct deposit, or if it was deposited to more than one account, a physical check will be mailed to you at the address on your tax return. If you have not filed taxes, it is likely that the IRS will attempt to get your address from other agencies, like the Social Security Administration or the Department of Veteran's Affairs.

**What if I am a dependent?**

Feels bad, man.

It's worth noting that eligibility is based on your dependency status for 2020, so if you were claimed as a dependent in 2019 and can't be claimed as a dependent in 2020, you should get the $1,200 (or the lower amount if your income is high), just not until they file their 2020 return.

Finally, it's important to know that dependency status is not elective. You are either a dependent or you are not a dependent according to IRS rules.

**Is this just an ""advance"" on my tax refund?**

No. Assuming you're eligible, the money is a credit and not an advance on money you would have been owed already.

**What if I am sent an amount that is higher than my 2020 income would allow?**

There were some initial reports that the excess would come out of your future tax refund, but the consensus seems to be that you get to keep the money.

According to [this article from CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/politics/stimulus-payments/index.html):

&gt; And those who make more this year than last would not have to pay back any stimulus money they receive if they end up exceeding the thresholds. The payments would not be subject to tax, and those who owe back taxes would still get a check.

The [Washington Post has a similar statement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/coronavirus-stimulus-check-calculator/).

**The IRS does not have my direct deposit information. What can I do?**

&gt; [In the coming weeks, [the US] Treasury plans to develop a web-based portal for individuals to provide their banking information to the IRS online, so that individuals can receive payments immediately as opposed to checks in the mail.](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payments-what-you-need-to-know)

# Stock market turbulence

It's very natural to be feel concerned when there's a large drop in the stock market, especially after such a long period of growth, but it's important to keep perspective and avoid making rash decisions.

First, take a deep breath. Market downturns are not uncommon or unusual. [Between 1980 and 2017, there were **11 market corrections and 8 bear markets**.](https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/NewsPerspectiveMktDownturns)

[Trying to time the market rarely turns out well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unFn-ddtqiM&amp;t=4) and most people trying to enter or exit the market based on emotion, gut feelings, and everyone's predictions end up doing far worse than if they had simply continued business as normal. **[Stick to your plan and stay the course.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2jbtyu/investment_pro_tip_stay_the_course/)**

To quote Warren Buffett: **[""to buy or sell on current news is just crazy""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaXmmaEs-hU&amp;t=24)**.

Don't make an emotional decision, don't try to predict where the market is headed in the short run, and make decisions for the long run. You're investing for decades, not trying to predict the Dow Jones or S&amp;P 500 next week, next month, or even next year.

# Being financially prepared and practicing sound finances

1. [Budget your money and reduce expenses.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_0.3A_budget_and_reduce_expenses.2C_set_realistic_goals) Fundamental to a sound financial footing is knowing where your money is going. Budgeting helps you see your sources of income less your expenses. You should minimize your expenses to the extent practical.

2. [Build an emergency fund.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_1.3A_build_an_emergency_fund) An emergency fund should be a relatively liquid sum of money that you don't touch unless something unexpected comes up. For most people, 3 to 6 months of expenses is good. A larger emergency fund may be warranted if your income is variable or uncertain. If you're in credit card debt, aim for one month of expenses and focus the rest of your money on paying down debt.

3. Don't check out of your finances. Continue following the steps in [""How to handle $""](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) as best possible starting at the beginning of the flowchart. If you can't make rent, contact your landlord. If you have trouble paying your mortgage, see below. If there are bills you can't pay, research your options and contact the company. Simply not paying a bill without any communication is almost certainly not your best option.

4. There's more good stuff you should be doing in this [video from Bogleheads](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Video:_Start_with_a_Sound_Financial_Lifestyle) and the [PF wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index).

# Travel

If you have travel planned, read *[Coronavirus &amp; Your Finances: What to Know and Do](https://clark.com/personal-finance-credit/coronavirus-finances/#travel)* from Clark Howard.

Also see the [megathread on /r/travel](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/fha30l/europe_to_us_travel_suspension_megathread_for/) for news and updates on the US travel suspension and other impacts the virus is having on travel plans.

# Refinancing

[If you're in the market for refinancing your mortgage, it may be worth considering](https://clark.com/homes-real-estate/when-should-i-refinance-mortgage-2020/), but if you don't have a healthy emergency fund and extra cash, you may not want to refinance right now due to the up-front costs.

# Federal student loans (Minor update on April 10th)

The CARES Act has some provisions to aid people with federal student loans including:

- Borrowers will be able to pause payments on federal student loans until September 30th, 2020.
- There will be no interest charged against your federal student loans until September 30th, 2020.
- Involuntary collection of defaulted student loans via garnishment of wages, social security, and tax refunds is also being suspended.

Key points:

- Private student loans are not affected.
- [If your loan is federally-held, you do not need to take any action to suspend payments. Your federal student loan servicer will suspend all payments automatically. You do not need to contact your student loan servicer.](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-student-loans-and-coronavirus-pandemic/)
- If your loan is *not* federally-held (i.e., federal student loans held by commercial lenders), do not assume you can pause payments without contacting your servicer. You may want to look into income-driven payment plans.

Read https://myfedloan.org/borrowers/covid/ for more information and updates.

# Federal tax payment deadline, filing deadline, and IRA deadline extended to July 15th (Updated on March 28th)

Key points:

1. [Both the filing deadline and the payment deadline are now being extended to July 15th.](https://twitter.com/stevenmnuchin1/status/1241002750483324930)

  [The IRS has also stated that the deadline for making contributions to your 2019 IRA is now July 15th.](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/filing-and-payment-deadlines-questions-and-answers)

2. **State deadlines are not affected by the extension**, but some states are providing extensions (the terms may differ, though). [The AICPA is maintaining a summary of states' filing and payment guidance due to Coronavirus.](https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/advocacy/tax/downloadabledocuments/coronavirus-state-filing-relief.pdf)

3. If you are receiving a refund, you should probably still file earlier.

# Many mortgage owners will be eligible to have their mortgage payments reduced or suspended for up to 12 months (New on March 20th)

Key points:

1. [The move covers about half of all home loans in the U.S. — those guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie. But regulators expect that the entire mortgage industry will quickly adopt a similar policy.](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/818343720/homeowners-hurt-financially-by-the-coronavirus-may-get-a-mortgage-break)
2. You can't just stop paying your mortgage. Contact your servicer to find out if you are eligible for this or if your servicer has adopted a similar policy.

# Retirement account changes (Updated on March 29th)

Key points:

1. The CARES Act provides an additional way for people to access cash by allowing the penalty-free withdrawal of up to $100,000 from qualified retirement accounts including IRA, 401(k), 403(b), 457(b), and several other types of accounts. It is also now easier to borrow money from 401(k) plans and the maximum loan size has increased to $100,000 from $50,000. Any loans due in 2020 are also being extended.

  In addition, some other rules related to retirement plan distributions have been suspended or modified.

  For details and **numerous warnings** about why you should try to avoid making early withdrawals, read these articles:

t3_gj0z9b,"For all the 2020 graduates and those who are now turning 18, plan ahead to open a new bank account that is solely in your name.","It's generally required for a parent to co-sign a minor's bank account in the US. Once you turn 18, the best course of action is to establish an account in your name ONLY so you have sole control of it. It would even be better if you can establish the account at a different bank/credit union than the one the minor account was in, to avoid any inadvertent connections between the previous and new account.  Bank personnel can make mistakes and link up what they thought were similar accounts, or give close relatives unwelcome access to accounts in an attempt to be ""helpful"".

There are several reasons for this. Stories of people who are still using the accounts they had when they were minors who are shocked when their money is suddenly taken away for reasons beyond their control are not uncommon. Parents can have financial problems and either use the money to pay off their debts or the money is seized by the institutions that they owe. There could be disagreements between parents and their kids over the kid's life choices, so they take the money away as a punishment or for control. It could just be selfishness and greed, so the parents decide to just take the money. Who earned the money in the account doesn't matter. If two people are named on the account, the money belongs to both parties and the bank isn't going to stop someone on the account from withdrawing the cash.  Getting it back can be a difficult legal process, if it's even possible.

Having your own account does not mean that parents can't send money if their child needs it. All they need is the account and routing number (the same information that would be on a check) to deposit money into the account. In addition, PayPal, Zelle, Venmo, or any number of banking apps are available they could use to send money if they're still financially supporting their kids or even just want to occasionally send some money as a gift. Other excuses may have good intentions at heart, but from a safety and security standpoint, it's best to establish an independent banking account.",personalfinance,graduate turning plan ahead open new bank account solely name,generally required parent sign minor bank account turn best course action establish account name sole control would even better establish account different bank credit union one minor account avoid inadvertent connection previous new account bank personnel make mistake link thought similar account give close relative unwelcome access account attempt helpful several reason story people still using account minor shocked money suddenly taken away reason beyond control uncommon parent financial problem either use money pay debt money seized institution owe could disagreement parent kid kid life choice take money away punishment control could selfishness greed parent decide take money earned money account matter two people named account money belongs party bank going stop someone account withdrawing cash getting back difficult legal process even possible account mean parent send money child need need account routing number information would check deposit money account addition paypal zelle venmo number banking apps available could use send money still financially supporting kid even want occasionally send money gift excuse may good intention heart safety security standpoint best establish independent banking account,graduate turning plan ahead open new bank account solely name generally required parent sign minor bank account turn best course action establish account name sole control would even better establish account different bank credit union one minor account avoid inadvertent connection previous new account bank personnel make mistake link thought similar account give close relative unwelcome access account attempt helpful several reason story people still using account minor shocked money suddenly taken away reason beyond control uncommon parent financial problem either use money pay debt money seized institution owe could disagreement parent kid kid life choice take money away punishment control could selfishness greed parent decide take money earned money account matter two people named account money belongs party bank going stop someone account withdrawing cash getting back difficult legal process even possible account mean parent send money child need need account routing number information would check deposit money account addition paypal zelle venmo number banking apps available could use send money still financially supporting kid even want occasionally send money gift excuse may good intention heart safety security standpoint best establish independent banking account

I want to be clear that I have a huge balance. There is no way I’d expect to get a free pass. So I’m still very happy, and happy to hear others have similar unexpected positive surprises too.

After telling them my situation, the support person offered me a term of 1% APR repaid over 5 years, as long as I don’t miss payments and close my credit card account.

This is extraordinarily generous. There was no screaming either. The support person’s kindness reverberated over the phone. There was maybe a 2 minute call wait.

This may sound like an ad, but it’s not. I just feel really grateful. I know many of you own Discover cards too, so it’s worth sharing.

t3_gj5apj,MAJOR warning if you have a Great Lakes student loan right now,"TLDR; Great Lakes submitted the WRONG student loan status code to the three credit bureaus for ALL of their customers with student loans (as part of the CARES act) and it's causing everyone's credit scores to drop 40-50 points.

I'm in the midst of buying a house and my lender pulled my credit yesterday. She told me what it was and I was shocked, it was lower than I thought. I know numbers fluctuate from free services like Discover and Credit Karma, so I looked at Credit Karma to see the numbers from two of the bureaus, and sure enough, a MAJOR drop of 45 points on both of them over a 4 day update period. I know the numbers themselves aren't super accurate, but the trends sure are.

I saw some articles on this subreddit today alluding to this issue but I wanted to verify the info. I googled and found ONE article about this [here](https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/atlanta/student-loan-borrowers-discover-significant-drop-credit-score-following-cares-act-protections/DBNHS5ODKBCNHOE7VKU3RWNFVI/). It was actually pretty informative and accurate.

I called Great Lakes and a woman confirmed that it was true: their company had provided the wrong 'code' to the credit bureaus, essentially causing everyone's student loans to look they are in REAL forbearance/deferral. I asked if it was worth looking at my account to see if I was one of the ones affected and she told me that it wasn't necessary because it affected everyone across the board. Wut.

My follow up was 'when is this going to be fixed?' and she said on May 31st they send their normal monthly report to the three bureaus and it will have the correction in there and will set everyone's accounts back (yeah right! Trust but verify!). As for when the bureaus will fix it once they receive the new information, I am still sitting on hold with one of them now to find out.

The last thing I asked her was if this was written publicly anywhere so that I can show my lender proof of this information. She said that they don't have it posted anywhere. WTF! No press release, no statement, NOTHING. Feels weird to know about something that affects so many people, yet there's only one article on it.

I'll update this post once I talk to someone at TransUnion. What a crazy year.

**EDIT: Since Credit Karma pulls Vantage Scores, I wanted to see what my FICO scores were. I signed up for a free trial with Experian's service that gives me access to all 3 bureaus' credit FICO 8 scores. It also has, just for Experian scores, a breakdown of a specific credit score for mortgage, auto lending, and credit cards. The  only one that was slightly low, at the level my lender would have seen, was the mortgage one. I cannot see 'trends' here to see if it had dropped recently.**

**Conclusively, I cannot confirm yet for SURE whether my lender uses a FICO 2, FICO 8, or Vantage score. Going to talk to them this morning.**

**EDIT: Sidenote cuz I thought this was pretty cool: as part of the trial of the experian service (and I would hope the other bureaus have something similar), you can use a 'score simulator' to click scenarios to see specifically what your credit score will do when you get a new credit card, pay off credit card balances, close down a credit card, etc. Thought that was pretty cool. It's only on the FICO 8 score model though, not the mortgage, auto, or credit card one.**

**EDIT: My mortgage lender talked to the credit company and they said they use the following scores to determine my rates:**  
**Experian: Fair Isaac v2**  
**Transunion - FICO Classic 4**  
**Equifax - FICO Classic**

**In conclusion, I'm calling this the ""Great"" Mishap of 2020. As far as I know, unless anyone says otherwise in this thread to me, Great Lakes screwing up the code is only affecting the Vantage Score calculations (used by Credit Karma) and not Fair Isaac or FICO.**",personalfinance,major warning great lake student loan right,tldr great lake submitted wrong student loan status code three credit bureau customer student loan part care act causing everyone credit score drop point midst buying house lender pulled credit yesterday told shocked lower thought know number fluctuate free service like discover credit karma looked credit karma see number two bureau sure enough major drop point day update period know number super accurate trend sure saw article subreddit today alluding issue wanted verify info googled found one article actually pretty informative accurate called great lake woman confirmed true company provided wrong code credit bureau essentially causing everyone student loan look real forbearance deferral asked worth looking account see one one affected told necessary affected everyone across board wut follow going fixed said may send normal monthly report three bureau correction set everyone account back yeah right trust verify bureau fix receive new information still sitting hold one find last thing asked written publicly anywhere show lender proof information said posted anywhere wtf press release statement nothing feel weird know something affect many people yet one article update post talk someone transunion crazy year edit since credit karma pull vantage score wanted see fico score signed free trial experian service give access bureau credit fico score also experian score breakdown specific credit score mortgage auto lending credit card one slightly low level lender would seen mortgage one cannot see trend see dropped recently conclusively cannot confirm yet sure whether lender fico fico vantage score going talk morning edit sidenote cuz thought pretty cool part trial experian service would hope bureau something similar use score simulator click scenario see specifically credit score get new credit card pay credit card balance close credit card etc thought pretty cool fico score model though mortgage auto credit card one edit mortgage lender talked credit company said use following score determine rate experian fair isaac transunion fico classic equifax fico classic conclusion calling great mishap far know unless anyone say otherwise thread great lake screwing code affecting vantage score calculation used credit karma fair isaac fico,major warning great lake student loan right tldr great lake submitted wrong student loan status code three credit bureau customer student loan part care act causing everyone credit score drop point midst buying house lender pulled credit yesterday told shocked lower thought know number fluctuate free service like discover credit karma looked credit karma see number two bureau sure enough major drop point day update period know number super accurate trend sure saw article subreddit today alluding issue wanted verify info googled found one article actually pretty informative accurate called great lake woman confirmed true company provided wrong code credit bureau essentially causing everyone student loan look real forbearance deferral asked worth looking account see one one affected told necessary affected everyone across board wut follow going fixed said may send normal monthly report three bureau correction set everyone account back yeah right trust verify bureau fix receive new information still sitting hold one find last thing asked written publicly anywhere show lender proof information said posted anywhere wtf press release statement nothing feel weird know something affect many people yet one article update post talk someone transunion crazy year edit since credit karma pull vantage score wanted see fico score signed free trial experian service give access bureau credit fico score also experian score breakdown specific credit score mortgage auto lending credit card one slightly low level lender would seen mortgage one cannot see trend see dropped recently conclusively cannot confirm yet sure whether lender fico fico vantage score going talk morning edit sidenote cuz thought pretty cool part trial experian service would hope bureau something similar use score simulator click scenario see specifically credit score get new credit card pay credit card balance close credit card etc thought pretty cool fico score model though mortgage auto credit card one edit mortgage lender talked credit company said use following score determine rate experian fair isaac transunion fico classic equifax fico classic conclusion calling great mishap far know unless anyone say otherwise thread great lake screwing code affecting vantage score calculation used credit karma fair isaac fico
t3_gjl846,Problematic engagement ring! The billing account from hell.,"Hello Personal Financiers!  This is my story, and personally not a fun one. This last Presidents’ Day I decided to take the big once (hopefully) in a lifetime step and purchase an engagement ring for the one love of my life! How exciting! I went to the store, placed the down deposit and the friendly charismatic sales person was more than eager to ring it up as it was not cheap! The sales lady advised me that they would reach out in 4-8 weeks to let me know when my ring is ready. I was also told I would receive my billing in the mail! Shortly after this order the Covid-19 lockdown went into place in my area. The jewelry store was now effectively closed until further notice... and still is. So I sat tight and waited for a billing statement or account information to begin my payments on a ring. The statements never came and the jeweler never reached out. I figured it was a product of store shutdown and wasn’t too worried. Fast forward to today, This morning I received a notification that my credit dropped 70 points! I damn near had a heart attack! Low and behold it’s the jeweler claiming I have a delinquent account by 30-90 days. I’m aghast by this. How was I supposed to pay on an account when I don’t know the account information?

t3_gjl4gx,"Switched jobs, not sure what to do with 401k from my last company","I just switched jobs. I have over $10K in my 401k with my last company (managed by Prudential). 

They sent me a letter with my options:
-keep the money in the plan
-roll money into a rollover IRA
-roll money into my new employer’s 401k plan (managed by Fidelity)

I think I’d prefer to keep the money in a 401k plan, whether I keep it in the old employer’s account or roll it over to the new one. I don’t really want to deal with taxes etc. from rolling it into an IRA, unless there would be a big benefit to doing so that outweighs the tax hassle. Also, I’m getting a $40k raise with this new job so I expect to have to pay higher taxes. 

So I guess the question is do I keep it in the old account or roll it into my new employer’s plan, and why? What is the “best practice” for when I eventually switch jobs again in the future?

t3_gjj8rh,A dozen years of over contributing to a Roth IRA,"tldr: My friend has been over contributing to a Roth IRA for 12 years and needs to know what to do.

\--

My friend and I somehow got onto the topic of the Retirement Savings Credit and I mentioned that he should plug his Roth IRA contribution into Turbo Tax to see if he qualifies for it.  Much to our surprise, inputting the Roth IRA contribution actually did the opposite, it led to an increase in the amount owed.  Before this year he had always done his taxes by hand.

Upon some investigating we found that that the income limit  for Roth IRA contributions is $10,000 (?!) for someone who files married but separately (and actually live together).  His income is well above $10k.

So now my friend is starting to freak out a bit because he then tells me he has been contributing to a Roth IRA for 12 years and has been filing married/separately the entire time (his wife has student loan issues).

He doesn't keep his paperwork for anything really but estimates that he has been investing approximately $3,000 each year and his income has always been above $10k.

So what is he looking at?  6% penalty on each and every single $3,000 contribution for each and every single year?  That's like $14,000 in penalties, right?  For $36,000 in contributions that seems pretty steep.

Then he would still have to take all this money out of the Roth IRA, right?  So he would have to pay a 10% penalty and income taxes on the earnings (since he does not seem to have a qualified exception)?

He has no idea what his gains are but if we assume $10k in gains that could be $1,000 in a 10% penalty and, say, $1,500 in 2020 income taxes (not sure his tax rate, but let's just say 15%).

So now he has to pay the $14,000ish in contribution penalty and $2,500 in penalties and taxes on the earnings, so $16,500 in total?

Please someone tell me that we are wrong in our understanding of the consequences on his contributions!  This seems ridiculously harsh.  He has a call out to an accountant but who knows when he'll actually be able to go in for an appointment with this lockdown we are in.

I put my two weeks in, and my employer said they would not need me the next two weeks and that that day (last Friday) would be my last day.

The training occurred from September 2019 to November 2019, at which point I withdrew from the training without completing it. In January 2020, my employer amended the company policies from stating that training occurring within (6) months of terminating employment should be paid back by the employer, to ALSO say that “incomplete” training should be reimbursed by the employee. At the time, I was not asked to pay back any money, as the policy was not in place when I terminated my training. But now that I am leaving, my employer is stating that I have had this “debt” to the company regardless of not being informed of it until today.

t3_gj7eb5,My bank LOWERED my auto rate!!!!,"Today I called my bank who does my car loan. 

Back story: when i got approved for my car loan, I had just switched job fields, so getting approved was not an easy task. I got approved in November 2018 for 7.4%.

In the last year, my credit score has gone up quite a bit and I feel like 7.4% is outrageous for my car loan.

So I called my bank today and asked them if they could look into refinancing my loan. She said they dont do existing customer refinances. But she said she would see if they could qualify me for a lower interest rate on my current loan.

She came back on the phone and offered me a 4.6% rate, no hard credit check needed, for a one time $50 processing fee that gets added on to the final payment of the loan, or final payoff, whichever comes first. 

My payment just went from $266 a month to $200 a month. And this happened in one 10 minute phone call, no credit check, and no hassle with dealing with a new bank.

I was planning on refinancing but now I dont have to. This is amazing news for me, and nothing like this has ever happened hassle-free.

t3_gjgdlt,Debt is greater than income at the moment. Requesting advice on not being overwhelmed.,"I quit my job in March and spent the past few months focusing on my therapy sessions. Boy, I've never been happier and more focused before. My therapist and I have worked through several reasons why I spend excessive money. It was quite eyeopening, and I'm kinda upset that I spent the past 6 years wasting away money. But that's the old me, so whatever. 

I started a new job earlier this month. My current job pays $4/hour less and no commission, but it's work from home and a much better industry. 

At this point, I have:

* Frozen my credit cards in ice, placed in back of freezer

* Removed my credit cards from: Paypal, Walmart, Target, Amazon, Google Play, etc.

* Sold unwanted clothing and electronics

* [Written out my total monthly debt payments](https://imgur.com/a/kE17h9m)

This is where the overwhelmed part comes in at. I expect to make $1400 a month, with $900 in monthly debt payments. My monthly budget is as follows:

RENT &amp; UTILITIES | MEDICAL | FOOD | TRANSPORTATION
---------|----------|----------|----------
520 | 400 | 200 | 240

So I'm overwhelmed by how much I owe and how little I make. Also, WHY WILL IT TAKE 6 YEARS OF PAYING 900 A MONTH TO PAY ALL OF THIS OFF?! (/s)

Holding an additional part time job overwhelmed me the 3 times I've tried it. It made it even more difficult to do well at the full time job.

t3_gjhepv,"$30k in up to date debt, $17k in collections -- wondering if I should start a Debt Management Plan and settle for 50% of the loan currently in collections?","Hi there! I am hoping to get some advice regarding my current debt situation. Yes, I am $47k in debt and obviously very concerned about it. I moved to Los Angeles a year and a half ago, and was unable to find a job as quickly as I expected -- in the year it took to find one, I blew through my savings and took out a few loans in order to keep my head above water (I WAS working at the time -- I commuted weekly to San Diego to work 30 hours a week at my last job there, but it wasn't enough). The 17k loan was basically a refinance of an earlier large loan from a different creditor. Because I was unable to find a job for so long, I defaulted on this loan (choosing to stay current on my other loans/credits in order to continue having a good relationship with my credit union) and it was sent to collections last December.

&amp;nbsp;

I was sent a letter in April from American Recovery Service Inc. claiming they now had my debt and offering to settle for 50% of the amount due ($17087 &gt; $8500). I missed the 21 day deadline to respond due to the hectic stress of the pandemic, and am wondering it its worth it to reach out to them. From what I've gathered while doing research, settlements usually mean you pay everything right then and there... which I obviously can't.

&amp;nbsp;

I reached out to a nonprofit credit counseling company and had them look at my debt. They sent me a Debt Management Plan that claims I will be paid off on my debt in 3 years, but this does NOT include the loan that is in collections. I emailed the company back asking why the loan in collections was not included and if they are doing anything to help out their clients affected by the pandemic. My credit agency is pushing back due dates and willing to work with me when I get behind, and I'm not sure that would also be possible with the DMP. The DMP monthly payment would be $968.

&amp;nbsp;

My credit was actually really good before my loan payments fell behind, and I know it's likely shit now. I've been too scared to check it...

&amp;nbsp;

Current Bills:

- $1400 Rent
- $75 Electricity/Trash
- $35 Gas
- $50 Internet
- $85 Car Insurance
- $115 Health Insurance
- $235 Car Payment ($3070 left on car loan, car is 6 years old and in great shape)
- $250 Personal Loan 1 ($8870 left, 16.35% interest rate)
- $170 Personal Loan 2 ($5930 left, 16.35% interest rate)
- $260 Credit Card ($12930 balance, 13% interest rate)
- $60 Care Credit Line ($1700 balance, 14.9% interest rate)
- $80 Cell Phone
- $75 Cat related expenses


&amp;nbsp;

Total: $2900 before food/gas/etc

&amp;nbsp;

Total with Lending Club Loan, not included above: $3350

&amp;nbsp;

I was lucky enough to land a job in October, then another in December, so from end of December through March I was working 70-80 hours per week (because of the debt I stupidly incurred). I work in hospitality though, and both of my hotels closed the same day due to COVID-19. I am currently on Unemployment.

&amp;nbsp;

Income After Taxes/month (before COVID-19): $4000, at the least
Income After Taxes/month (EDD): $3000

&amp;nbsp;

Unfortunately, EDD bases your eligibility on the first four of the last five quarters.... and I made half of what I did at the most during that time. I have been meaning to call them to see if they will change it to what I made in the 5th quarter and this backpay me for the difference, but I'm not holding my breath that they will agree. I will likely not return to work until July. I wish I could say that I put a lot towards savings during these three months, but I had a few other debts I needed to pay off and expenses I could not avoid.

&amp;nbsp;

If it helps, I am single and live alone. My family are all living barely above the poverty line, and have all left the state. Due to my career, I have to stay in LA.

&amp;nbsp;

Tldr: I am wondering if it is worth it to contact the collections agency that currently owns my $17k loan and try to settle it for half off (and if they will do payment plans?) or what other options I have besides ignoring it and hoping for the best. I am also wondering if a debt management plan is a smart choice to pay down my other debt.

t3_gjmzyv,Is it irresponsible to rent at this price?,"Hey guys,

My net pay (after taxes) per month is: $4,137.94

I live in NYC and the place I'm looking to rent is in a luxury building. The rent is $1350 per month (discounted due to pandemic), and the utility bills will be anywhere between $70-$100 per month.

I do not have any debt. My only consistent after tax recurring expenses are groceries which amount to about $450 per month, and Roth IRA contributions at $568 per month.

Trasporation is covered via an FSA in which I allocate $127 per month from my pay check (Will modify since I don't use public transportation currently). And I automatically deposit $984.86 into a 401K (10% annual salary with employer matching 75% up to 6% and maxing HSA annually).

The lease would be for 10 months at which time I would could renew or leave. I have made rough calculation in which I would be paying about 35% of net pay on rent, closer to 44% once utilities are included.

My question is to get thoughts from the community even though the quality of life would be significantly better, especially during times like these: ""Is this is fically irresponsible?""

t3_gjmvv1,"Started a job without realizing I was already approved for unemployment, worried for my very immune compromised parent. Could really use some advice.","Hello friends, in a bit of a pickle. I was laid off from a paid part-time internship in mid March, moved back home with my parents when in-person classes were cancelled to help take care of my father who is battling cancer. I applied for unemployment in mid April but with 18 credit hours of online class finishing up and my father starting a new chemo treatment life has just been kind of a blur the last month or so and I’m kind of just now getting my head straight. 

My savings were basically depleted from not working from mid March-early May, so I got a job as fast as I could figuring I hadn’t been eligible for unemployment since i never got a letter in the mail or an email saying I had been (this is the f*** up). I started working about a week ago as a temporary employee at a large grocery chain. I wear two masks to work and use hand sanitizer any chance I get, but the general public does not usually take those same precautions. My father was denied his chemo treatment today due to his white blood cell count being too low and was told to be extra careful to make sure not to get sick as any infection could send him to the hospital. This prompted me to log into my states (MI) unemployment website and lo and behold I found a letter there saying I was approved for 39 weeks of unemployment by my state before I even started my job. I also missed the first window for certification according to the determination letter. This means instead of potentially risking my parents lives by going to work everyday I could’ve been paid more to stay home and help my father. Is there anything I can do?

t3_gjmn5b,Is a Roth IRA a good investment vehicle for a teenager?,"My 16 y/o son just got a job at McDonald's working almost full-time (since he really doesn't have much schoolwork to do right now) and is making about $11/hr.

t3_gjmldj,"London based young opera singer about to begin a Masters, ideas for training or sources of income separate to music","Hi guys, Hope everyone's doing okay in these unprecedented(ha) times. I'm a 23 year old opera singer, about to finish my 4 year undergraduate degree in vocal performance and heading onto a masters in September. The typical route of a singer in the UK is to train for 8 years(roughly) while gaining experience etc. while you develop your vocal technique and knowledge. Even after those 8 years, paid work is extremely hard to come by for many years.

During this lockdown, my current lack of financial security has made me realise the importance of finding another source of income or qualification that will allow me to stay afloat until I can make enough from singing alone. Or if the singing does not work out, to fully commit to this second career.

I would love some advice on job suggestions, qualifications, training courses, or anything of the sort which will allow me to have options. I don't mind how long these course take or what is required, but preferably something that isn't a full-time course. I just ultimately would like to not get down the line in 5 years time, find out I won't make enough money from singing, and have to have this conversation with my self when I have a lot more bills to pay and a lot my student debt.

t3_gjl64n,How to get a 80/10/10 (Piggy Back) Loan?,"Hello,

First time here but my friend said this place is a great community.  Many thanks in advance for any help you might be able to offer.

I'm looking to buy a house this summer.  I'm at the point of getting a pre-approval and have decided that an 80/10/10 loan is probably best for me.  First time home buyer, 800+ credit score, and just enough to put 10% down for a house in my price range.  After doing some rough math I'm certain I can afford the two mortgages - the 2nd mortgage is practically what I would be paying in PMI anyways.

My question is, how does one actually get pre-approved for an 80/10/10 loan?  It's my understanding that often the two loans are from different banks, is this correct?  Would it be best/easiest to use a mortgage broker?  If I go the broker route, and chose a lender paid broker, does that mean I effectively get their services for free?  Or would that just mean I'm paying either higher closings costs or will have a higher rate with a with a loan from a broker that's lender paid?

My 2. interview went well, business case not as much as I have no background in it","Hi, so I with public affairs background had a second round of an interview as a regional lead in 3 Eastern European markets for an ecommerce company. My advantage (not a requirement in the posting) is that I speak all three languages.  However no business school or ecommerce experience (required). The rest of the requirements I fulfill.

I had a one hour interview with my future boss, he seemed kind and smiling during the interview, i think i answered the questions well, even the more technical ones, he saw that I have done my research and tried hard.

The business case went okay, I watched hours of videos but obviously I made mistakes, he had to correct me or question my calculations a few times, I got stuck/confused once,I admitted I haven't done a business case before but I really enjoyed it. I came to a conclusion in the end, but what matters more is my analytical thinking.

The second part was with his colleague, it was cut shorter (first one got prolonged), he seemed a bit more distant, I'm not sure I convinced him, I was also quite brain dead after an hour of interview anyway.

My friend said to maybe offer taking only 70-80% of salary for the first 2-3 months while i get the hang of the business side. I've never heard of this, but she said her employer liked the idea. Maybe as an ecommerce startup that reached one billion, they could appreciate my flexibility and this offer to compromise. Thoughts? Is it desperate/needy or is it a creative approach to deal with my gap?

On Experian and Transunion my credit history is accurate (7.5 years after averaging). Equifax lists them as ‘Closed - Paid in Full’ with 2.5 years of credit history as an average.  As a consequence my Equifax score is consistently 30-40 points lower than the other two — everything else the same.

t3_gjmlga,URGENT Tax question!!!! (Panicking here),"From last year's taxes, I realized I owed my state money because I wasn't withholding enough (I'm a 25 y/o single female).

I changed my SC State withholding from 1 to 0, hoping this would minimize the taxes I owe at end of year. However, I just got my recent paystub, and it is around $20 more than my previous one (implying that less taxes were withheld, so I will owe *more* at the end of the year). Why would this be?

It looks like while my SC state tax withheld *increased* (from $203.87 to $222.56), my federal taxes withheld *decreased* from ($505.43 to $466.01) Why is this, and should I revert back to the withholding I had before?",personalfinance,urgent tax question panicking,last year tax realized owed state money withholding enough single female changed state withholding hoping would minimize tax owe end year however got recent paystub around previous one implying tax withheld owe end year would look like state tax withheld increased federal tax withheld decreased revert back withholding,urgent tax question panicking last year tax realized owed state money withholding enough single female changed state withholding hoping would minimize tax owe end year however got recent paystub around previous one implying tax withheld owe end year would look like state tax withheld increased federal tax withheld decreased revert back withholding

t3_gjdzep,"Inherited $12,500 from grandma’s life insurance and I want to make the most of it","My grandma passed away almost exactly two months ago and left money to everyone in my family via her life insurance policies. I was left $12,500, though technically it was left to my mom so she’s trying to figure out the best way to transfer it to me.

My boyfriend and I have plans to hopefully get married and start a family within the next few years, and I would like to use some of the money towards those goals. Not only would it make them more achievable, but it would make it feel like my grandma is helping with those things, so to speak.

That being said, in the mean time, I’m not sure what the best plan is for the money. It’s a large amount, especially for someone my age, and I really don’t want to touch it unless there’s an emergency. I also would like it if I could put it somewhere where at least part of it is making more money in the mean time. I’m not knowledgeable enough to invest, so I was thinking either a savings account or a CD? Any other options?

Honestly the money is the last thing I care about right now since my grandma was a huge part of my life and one of the people who raised me and it feels like a part of me is missing, but I know she wanted everyone to be taken care of even after she was gone and I want to make sure that’s the case.",personalfinance,inherited grandma life insurance want make,grandma passed away almost exactly two month ago left money everyone family via life insurance policy left though technically left mom trying figure best way transfer unemployed due medical reason pandemic started collecting unemployment week live mom boyfriend boyfriend plan hopefully get married start family within next year would like use money towards goal would make achievable would make feel like grandma helping thing speak said mean time sure best plan money large amount especially someone age really want touch unless emergency also would like could put somewhere least part making money mean time knowledgeable enough invest thinking either saving account option honestly money last thing care right since grandma huge part life one people raised feel like part missing know wanted everyone taken care even gone want make sure case,inherited grandma life insurance want make grandma passed away almost exactly two month ago left money everyone family via life insurance policy left though technically left mom trying figure best way transfer unemployed due medical reason pandemic started collecting unemployment week live mom boyfriend boyfriend plan hopefully get married start family within next year would like use money towards goal would make achievable would make feel like grandma helping thing speak said mean time sure best plan money large amount especially someone age really want touch unless emergency also would like could put somewhere least part making money mean time knowledgeable enough invest thinking either saving account option honestly money last thing care right since grandma huge part life one people raised feel like part missing know wanted everyone taken care even gone want make sure case

Our current mortgage provider won't give us the amount needed for a house, as they won't accept my income, as they need 2 years of self employed accounts. If both our incomes were considered, the typical (4x income) amount would be more than we are actually looking to borrow.

t3_gjmchj,Currently paying two separate leases and not sure if there are any other options.,"Hi PF!

Context: In February, 2020 I accepted an offer to work at a new company in NYC. Currently living in Houston, TX.
My original start date was April, and I managed to find an apartment in the city in the first week of March and signed my lease quickly. At the time, my plan was to break my current lease in Houston and move the first week of April.



Unfortunately, as I’m sure you can tell by the timing, I had to postpone my move across the country due to the current lockdown.
As of right now, I’m currently paying rent for my apartment in Houston (where I will most likely be for the next month or two), and ALSO, paying rent for my apartment in NYC (which I haven’t even set foot in, yet...)

The NYC leasing office gave me the option to fill out an application to restructure the lease payment and provide some flexibility there, but unfortunately it is solely dependent on my “Loss of income due to the quarantine ”, which, I don’t necessarily qualify for—because I’m being paid normally as I work from home here in TX.

Just a quick note regarding “why don’t you just break the lease of one or the other?”, the Houston apartment is charging me 4-months rent upfront to give a 60-day notice, and the NYC apartment lease states I have to pay 3 months rent up front to give a 60 day notice. Both of which I will still have to pay the residual months (in the 60&amp; 90 day windows of my leaving.... which is a huge chunk of cheddar)



I predict I’m SOL, but figured there might be other clever and legal ways around this.

t3_gjmaql,Ex Fiancé opened credit card in my name years ago and transfer his balance onto it.,"Pretty much title. Back then it wasn’t unusual for her to open credit in my account since she was helping me build credit and was already AU on her credit cards already.

I just went with it. It was several grand. I pretty much forgot about it. Minimum monthly payments are still being paid. 

I have brought it up before our divorce and pretty much got told I agreed to it and nothing can be done. That I will have to believe that she will keep paying it off like she has. She has efficient income and funds but I’m wondering if there is anything that could be done? Suppose she stops paying and I get hit with the late payments.

After a recent review I'd asked about the fees and in the end we are paying about 2%/yr in fees. It was explained that the local broker gets about 85 basis points, Matson about 50bps, e-trade about 5bps and something called an ""acquisition fee"" gets the remaining bps \~1800bps.

The agent explained that the fees are much lower than using other investors who would be dinging us with transaction fee after transaction fee, thus totaling far greater than with them. With Matson, it's explained, the investment remain nearly unchanged, thus we have little to no additional fees.

My thought if that is the case, that our investments are stable, than what it the point of the agent?

t3_gjl8qp,Tech company offered EGPP Plan worth it? (US),"I am a software engineer working for a medium sized privately owned tech company that is, by many internal accounts, attempting to go public once they reach X valuation.

They clearly don't want to give up more equity in the company, so they are offering employees an interesting vehicle that I've never heard of. EGPP shares. Here are the basic rules:

* 1 EGPP share tracks 1 stock unit in value (but it isn't stock)
* Company stock is ultimately valued by the board (kind of odd to me) once a year, after getting input from a third party valuation company
* Employees can annually elect for up to $XXK of our (pre-tax) salary to go to purchasing EGPP shares 
* Employees purchase shares at a 15% discount and at the last set valuation price
* EGPP Shares are not stock, cannot be sold as stock, and can only have value extracted during a payment event, like the company gets acquired, or an IPO.

t3_gjkn60,Maryland &amp; Pennsylvania - 401k Deductible Income,"Hi all,

First time poster here and not too knowledgeable about taxes, so I apologize if my question has been previously discussed or if it doesn’t make sense. 

I lived in Maryland until 5/1 this year, and due to the pandemic, I’ve had to move back home to Pennsylvania. During these 4 months while living in Maryland, I maxed out my traditional IRA ($6k) and traditional 401k ($19.5k). 

While currently living in Pennsylvania, I’m still working in Maryland. I understand that these states have a reciprocity, so I will have to file a return in PA, not MD, for the amount of time that I live in PA during all of this.

I just learned that traditional IRA and traditional 401k contributions are not deductible from income in PA in the year of contribution.

My question to you is will I still be able to deduct these contributions ($25.5k) from my income if I continue to live in PA until the end of the year, since I made them during the 4 months while I was living in Maryland? 

Also, on a different topic that I’m just curious about, but I’m probably missing something - wouldn’t it make sense for all PA residents to contribute to a Roth 401k and Roth IRA since traditional contributions are not deductible in PA?

I apologize if my questions do not make sense - I just stumbled upon this info and would appreciate clarification!

Goals: 
-$150,000 Downpayment savings for a home in 2-3 years.  We are savings $2k per month aside from our retirement accounts.  
-Determine how to invest $10,000 in a brokerage account for 20+ year horizon.  High risk tolerance.  
-Determine how to invest $3k annual contributions to Roth IRA for 20+ year horizon. High risk tolerance.  

QUESTIONS:
1.) I am having a difficult time determining when to stop contributing to our 401k/457s and start putting into our Roth’s.  I’ve been advised to “put as much as you can” into the pre tax accounts but I appreciate the flexibility of the Roth’s and brokerage should we have unexpected financial expenses. How would you allocate it?

2.) What funds would you fill the brokerage and Roth IRA with?  And in which accounts? I’m risk tolerant so I’m leaning towards sector funds and overweighting with well performing/stable stocks.   I’d like to be healthily exposed to a healthcare index fund, IT and others.  I understand the mentality of the bogle method the three fund portfolio but with time on my side I want to be a bit more exposed.  

I think I hit all the points the bulletin asked for, if I’m missing anything please let me know.  I appreciate your time.

t3_gj67ay,I am about to lose $3000 with a dispute if Wayfair cannot locate the refund that Chase sent it back to them. What should I do?,"So this is a long story..

&amp;#x200B;

 

I placed an online order of coffee machine ($3119.43) from Wayfair on December 20th of 2019. The item supposed to arrive on the Dec 23rd and I received a box empty. I called Wayfair immediately for help on the same night and they told me to dispute the charge since they couldn’t help with that. I called Chase the next morning to start the dispute process (December 24th). Soon after the call with Chase the item showed up at my door but at this point it was too late. The item was supposed to be the Xmas gift for my friend and I received after Xmas so there was no point to keep. I already initiated the dispute with Chase earlier so I called Chase again to cancel the dispute and start the return process to receive my money back because it would be wrong to start a dispute but having an item in hand. I mailed it back to Wayfair on the 26th of December around 12:24 PM with the tracking number and I received a refund confirmation from the email for the refund of $3069.85 immediately after I dropped of the package (full amount minus the shipping charge of $49.58). Ever since then I have never received the refund from Wayfair for the any amount whatsoever. I called Wayfair after one week to check my refund status and they told me they received the item back and they are now aware of the dispute I placed. I told Wayfair I canceled the dispute, returned the item back to Wayfair and all I need know is to receive a refund because technicially the dispute was cancelled and I returned the merchandise. They agreed to it and the last communication I received from Wayfair was around January 3rd. Wayfair told me they already refunded me but I wasn’t sure if they referenced to the dispute or the actual item that I returned back to them. After a few weeks of unsuccessfully retrieving the refund, I went back to Chase and re-initiated the dispute with my credit card company on January of 26th providing all the information I had at the time including the tracking number and the refund confirmation email from Wayfair but I never received any money back. Ever since the reopen dispute with Chase in the late of January I never heard back from Chase or any updates from Chase. I assumed they were taking time to investigate because of the complication process (open-cancel-reopen) and with the COVID-19 I thought the process was taking longer than usual. However, on April 3rd, Chase sent me the later saying the charge is valid  and the fund were returned back to Wayfair on 1/7/2020 when I canceled the dispute on 12/26/2020. Chase cannot assist me any further. It is up to Wayfair to find the fund. I was furious and lost so I decided to call Wayfair and Chase again as a liaison to ask for the latest status. I spoke to this person named C from Advocacy team from Wayfair (4/24/2020) and was advised that Wayfair accepted the dispute report received from my bank and accepted the refund credit to be issued to me through my financial institution which doesn’t make any sense. I thought she referenced the original dispute so I had to send an email and explain the whole story to her but she never responded. I decided to call Chase again and spoke to B (Chase Dispute Supervisor) and she said that Chase already canceled the refund and the fund went back to Wayfair and advised me to call Wayfair to ask them where the fund is (I found this similar to the letter I received from Chase on April 3rd). At this point I was transferred to J who is also the customer advocacy at Wayfair (4/27/2020) and she advised me if Chase already canceled the refund then it would be an ARN number (confirmation number?) showing the bank send the funds over to Wayfair. I called Chase again and spoke to B this morning (5/5/2020) and asked her what the ARN number would be when Chase sent back the fund to Wayfair and she didn’t know but keep telling me to wait and wait. B mentioned that it should take up to 45 days for the merchant to receive the fund back to their bank account but it looks like it has been almost 130 days at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

After too long to handle this issue, I finally filed a complaint with Chase on CFPB to get more lights regarding this whole issue. I thought the issue could be solved but Chase Excutive team got back to me with the same response that I received from Chase Dispute Team but now having the ARN number. I was so happy and thought this will help me very much. I gave Wayfair the official letter with all related information but as of this morning I received a call from Wayfair saying the ARN number I provided was the first ARN number when I initiated the dispute. The second ARN (rebill) couldn't be locate and they have no clue. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is the letter I received from Chase.

""We completed our research into your $3,119.43 charge from WAYFAIR\*Wayfair that posted to your

account on December 22, 2019. On December 25, we issued a temporary credit for $3,119.43 because

you did not receive merchandise from the merchant. We spoke to you on December 26 and you

requested to cancel the dispute. We rebilled the charge to your account on December 26 as you

requested. We sent our enclosed letter dated December 27 to let you know we rebilled your account. 

We have enclosed your January 2020 billing statement, which shows the rebilled charge.

The merchant accepted your dispute on January 7, 2020, but we returned the funds of $3,119.43 to the

merchant’s bank on January 7 because you canceled the dispute on December 26, 2019.

We have reviewed all documentation you have provided to obtain a refund. We are not able to reopen the dispute as the funds were returned to the merchant’s bank on January 7, 2020. We apologize for the delay in our response when you sent an email on January 27. We show that we sent our enclosed letter dated February 27 informing you the funds were returned to the merchant’s bank.

We ask that you contact the merchant to resolve this matter. The acquirer reference number (ARN) is

XXXXX. They will need to contact their bank to locate the funds and issue a refund

to you as we do not have the funds. The rebilled charge will remain valid including any associated interest or fees. In addition, we have enclosed our letters dated April 3 and April 18 to let you know we are not able to issue a refund.""

At this stage I'm already exhausted and so confused. Now I have a rebill from Chase, I don't have a merchandise in hand because I already returned it.

I was planning on keeping 10k for an emergency fund and using the remaining 15k to invest as the downpayment.

It looks like M1 would make it easier to diversify and automate things.

I'd prefer to have just one active account for the time being. Should I withdraw all my funds out of Vanguard and move them to M1? Is it okay to have an empty Vanguard account or should I close it?

t3_gjb3tx,Parents are in a tough financial situation. What can I do to help them?,"TL;DR: Parents can’t get their debt under control, what can I do to help them?

With offices being closed, I (22M) have moved back home with my family during COVID to get out of the city. 

During this extended time at home, I am realizing that my parents are in rough financial shape (lawsuits from creditors, foreclosure, behind on taxes, etc.) and are in, what I am assuming to be, a large amount of debt. 

I explained the possibility of forbearance on their mortgage due to COVID, but they were behind on their obligations prior to COVID and forbearance has not been offered. 

I have money saved up that I can offer to help, but I’d rather get them professional assistance as it could have a lasting impact on their financial situation, as opposed to temporary relief if I were to pay a small portion of their balance for breathing room. 

Are there any programs available that would help them with their debt? I’ve seen mixed reviews about debt relief programs, and working with lawyers could be costly. Any input you all have would be greatly appreciated. 

I really want to help them with this, and it has been tough on me discovering the extent of their problems.

t3_gjigua,Can I Open A Roth IRA While Unemployed?,"Hi,

First off, huge thanks to everyone who created this subreddit and contribute to people's posts. I've been lurking and reading and I've found alot of helpful information.

I left my W-2 job at the end of the second week of January. Since then I've been an IC; I got paid one day as a production assistant for a huge event. I've also worked on one small project, but that barely made me around $125. I've been approved for UI benefits, and plan to use those funds to pay off credit card debt (around $2K), and I have money ready to put in an high-yield savings account as an emergency fund.

I'm 27, finished graduate school last year, and my graduate student loans are currently deferred. I'm living at home, and my monthly expenses are around $700 for now. I'm looking for full-time work at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Can I still open a Roth IRA and use the funds from my W-2 job to contribute to 2019?
2. If so, I'm debating between Fidelity and Schwab, any insights on who to go with based on my profile? I'm very new to all of this.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm aware that I wouldn't be able to contribute to 2020 until I earn income apart from unemployment.

Any insights are greatly appreciated; thank you!

Edit: I also read about Schwab acquiring TD...do you think this would give Schwab a leg up?

t3_gjhxeo,"If I was laid off with no return date and pay in lieu of notice, I was technically terminated, right?","Hi, sorry for the length here. Just trying to get some actual understanding behind my layoff as it's been very hard to find clarification. I was laid off (""indefinitely"" they said) at the end of March due to Covid, with no return date listed on my notice of separation. They also provided a check for two weeks of pay and checked the box on the NOS that said they were providing Pay In Lieu Of Notice. Almost everyone got laid off at the same time, minus a few ""essential"" people. So this means I was actually terminated, am I correct? 


I'm curious because they're starting to call some of us (oddly not all of us or any of our upper management but myself included) to ask if we want to come back. I was previously the head cashier, but when they called me they offered a general cashier position, not my previous one, and another prior coworker told me they offered her a different position as well. I'm also concerned because with school out and my normal babysitter high risk thus self isolating, I'm currently the primary caregiver for my special needs child, so it's impossible for me to currently return to work until either school's return or I have access to his babysitter (he's comfortable around her and she's got experience with his particular delays). Daycare isn't really a feasible option for us for a few reasons, and many here are still closed down. 


Anyways, I relayed that info to them and told them while I would like to eventually come back if I could, I'm not going to currently be able to due to the above, so I've been a little stressed that if they called to offer me work they might fill out a refusal form with unemployment. I'd like to think they wouldn't do that, as it's a local nonprofit ministry organization, but is that something they'd be able to theoretically do if they've laid me off in this particular manner, and if they do, would I have grounds to appeal?

t3_gjhbbx,What should I do about this debt collection?,"I received a collection agency call about a debt I have. It’s a $90 medical office bill from like 3-4 years ago. When I first received the bill, I tried to dispute it with the clinic because they miss-billed my insurance. Eventually they stopped sending me statements and I forgot about the whole thing. Anyways, I got a call about it from a collections agency. More specifically, I’ve been ignoring the call from the collections agency for a few months. I ran my credit report today and there haven’t been any collection dings on it so I don’t think they’ve reported it.. I still don’t agree with the bill and don’t really want to pay it. These are my arguments for not paying them:

I have excellent credit (700-800 range) so if they were to report it, my score won’t ultimately suffer much. But also if it did, I’m not making any big purchases in the near future. Maybe not even in the next 7 years.

I don’t think they would take me to court to try to garnish wages, because it’s a small sum and filing for small court is like a $40 fee plus lawyer fees. But if they did, I guess they can have the $90 then. Not sure if the margin is worth it.

On the other hand, I would keep getting these phone calls. Can’t block the number since it’s always different, but I could send them a cease and desist letter at which point I think they’d have to. 

OR maybe it would be best to just pay them? I don’t know. Am I right about the above things?

t3_gjhayp,Renting out my primary residence in another state? USA/SC/NC,"Hey all,
I just bought a house in upstate South Carolina in December.
It is my first home and I am now faced with an opportunity of free housing in NC, still close to my job in SC.
My girlfriend’s parents are leaving for California and are leaving the home to her for us to live in.
We won’t have to pay anything.
I want to rent out my house as I’ll be able to pay for it even while it’s vacant, I’m not concerned about our relationship, my job or the worst case of being “kicked out” as I could afford more in housing. I made $80k last year with projected $130k (basicly guaranteed) in the coming 3 years. My home is $135k so I feel comfortable having to make the occasional payment on both my rental and another housing situation (rent/another home, depending on time) for several months at a time. I’ve also saved $10k as an emergency savings which I may increase?

All my questions are regarding what do I need to know renting out my only primary residence?

Will my taxes change for the whole year?

How do I go about making it into a rental, legally?

It’s all come pretty quickly. We’d move in the house in about a month and I just want to know all that I might need to know?

Me and her will be splitting the income in the meantime until we potentially marry.
I’m on a 20 year mortgage at 3.25apr so I’m not exactly looking to make a profit over the payment. Just to make the monthly mortgage or more then share half.


Edit: House is built in 2000, 2000sqft
so not too old and decently sized.
I’m about replace the Air handler. Everything else is brand new basically.

t3_gjh6iz,Buying a truck with a lien,"I’m sure as you read this you already think it’s a terrible idea. You’ll probably still think it is after I explain, but humor me. 

My brother has a truck that needs work to run. He still owes around $3500 to the bank, and therefore the title has a lien on it. I offered him $1500 for the truck because given what needs to be done, that’s about all it’s worth. 

The issue is, my brother has a propensity to screw people over, family included (he once sold my dad’s car after my dad put the title in my brothers name for insurance reasons). He’s come a long way and is a much better person, but regardless, I’m **very** cautious. 

What I want to do is ensure that if I give him the $1500, that the title and ownership of the truck will be signed over to me once he finishes paying the loan. My worries are that 
1. I’ll give him the $1500, he’ll eventually pay off the loan and not sign over the title and sell/keep the truck

t3_gja3uq,Shopping for a new home and lender sent me this “price sheet” today. Does this sound right?,"I’m new to the home buying game and looking to buy my first house. I have a realtor and have been shopping around for lenders.

I had one send me a “fee sheet” today outlining everything that I’d be looking at in order to actually get the keys to the house. It surprised me that it was so high. 

I haven’t talked to him yet (he just emailed me the fee sheet) but I wanted to go in to the conversation with some general knowledge first.

My understanding is the “loan discount fee” is the same as buying down my interest. So basically I’m paying $3k upfront to have a lower interest rate? The rate I was quoted for interest today is 3.25%. This is an estimate for an approx $320k home. I live in CA if it matters

ORIGINATION CHARGES

Loan discount fee - $2926

Administration fee - $1055

OTHER CHARGES

Appraisal fee - 550

Credit report fee - 62

Tax service fee - 85

Flood certification fee - 8

Appraisal reinspection fee (May not need) - 200

Work verifications - 50

Closing/escrow fee - 963

Notary fee - 175 [$175 for a Notary?!]

Lenders title insurance - 14

Title - recording service fee - 14

Title - endorsements - 25

Title - New loan service fee - 340

Mortgage recording charge - 160

Daily interest charges - 405 (27.03 x 15 days)

Hazard insurance premium - 969 (80.75 x 12 months)

PMI/MIP/VA FF Reserves - 364 (60.72 x 6 months)

County property tax reserves - 2018 (336.46 x 6 months)

Owners title insurance (paid by seller) - 1065

Totals:
Est prepaid items/reserves - 3757

Est closing costs - 5497

Discount (borrower paid) - 2926

So a little over $12k in addition to the down payment. I did not expect that much. This is an estimate from him on a $320k house. 

Does this make sense? Is it reasonable? Any red flags or things that don’t look right?

t3_gjdnuf,"Account in collections in error, collections agency said they'll take care of it","Reposting since I didn't get an answer on /r/credit, hoping the fine folks of /r/personalfinance have some insight.

Last year in December, I was contacted by a collections agency about a deliquent account. At first, I thought they had the wrong number because I'm anal retentive about paying my bills in full and on time, but looked into it further and realized an old apartment complex made a mistake when I moved out and overcharged me for something that didn't appear on my account for several months. I had also received email confirmation that my account was settled and I would not be charged any further. When I called the apartment complex, they confirmed it was a mistake and said they would work with the collection agency to make sure I didn't get dinged. The agency seemed to recognize it as a mistake and stated that they would ""mark the account as paid in full and removed from your credit report."" They also stated it would be a few weeks until I'll see it reflected correctly on the reports.

I understand marking an account paid and removing the remark to be two different things - that marking an account as paid means that the debt was valid, and removing it means it won't show up at all. Can anyone offer insight and if I should push back on them to specifically remove it completely, or am I misunderstanding how this process works?

t3_gjm5y4,I think I scored the mortgage deal of the decade,"My wife and I were saving diligently to be able to pay 20% down on a conventional 30-year fixed (I’ve bought/sold 3 properties prior to this; all with at least 20% down) but then curiosity got the best of us and so we shopped for a mortgage... 

End result (loan is in final approval “clear-to-close” status):

- Type: 30 year fixed conventional
- Loan amount: $509,000
- Rate: 3.5%
- APR: 3.83%
- PMI: 0.49%
- Points: None
- Down payment: 3%
- Closing costs: $9824
- Principal &amp; Interest: $2286
- HOA: None

We decided that it was not worth it to suffer through another year of renting in a cramped apartment to save up over 120k cash (20% down + closing costs) and the more I look at these numbers the more I realize that we made the right choice (for us)

t3_gj1giy,I'm 26 years old and applying to grad school next year. How much should I be putting into my retirement vs. savings account?,"I'm 26 years old and recently started a job making $71k/year (up from $45k/year at my last job).  I have no debt of any kind. My assets include:

* Savings (Ally HYSA): $29k 
* Roth 401k: $21k
* Roth IRA: $12k

My most significant fixed costs are $830/month rent, $80/month for health insurance, $40/month to charity, and $35/month for cell/data service. Unfortunately, my new job doesn't provide any 401k match until after my first year, then they will match up to 6%. I've been putting in 10% of my paycheck anyway since I started about a month ago. My current plan is to put $750 from each paycheck into savings, which totals to $18k/year. I realize that I could max out my Roth IRA and/or contribute more to my 401k if I put less into my savings for graduate school. 

I plan on applying to master's of public health (MPH) next year, which means I would enroll in the Fall of 2022. The full tuition (not including any potential financial aid) of the MPH programs that I am looking at range from $35k to $70k. The MPH will take me out of the workforce for 1-2 years, depending on the program. I've basically hit the ceiling of what I can make in my field without an advanced degree. 

Here's my question: how should I prioritize contributing to my retirement savings vs. saving for graduate school? Here are some of my concerns:

* The power of compound interest has been pounded into me, so I know that contributing to my retirement in my 20s is important. However, I hate the idea of substantial debt and I worry that the interest rates that I would need to pay on potential loans would outweigh the interest earned on my retirement savings during the same period. 
* Would having a substantial sum in my savings account ($50-60k) when applying to grad school hurt my chances of receiving need-based aid? It would be frustrating to be penalized for saving.

t3_gj1sm4,23 year old with decent job looking for best path forward with debt management/house purchasing/Auto Buying decisions/ money saving,"Looking for advice

I'll try and keep this short. Here's a quick run down.

Background:
-23y/o graduated school May '19 
-Live at home with parents for now rent-free
-Work full time at a Fortune 100 company.
-$53,476.8 salary before tax. 
-9% of pre-tax salary goes to 401(k) 
-Takehome pay is about $37,128.54 annually ($1,428.09 every 2 weeks)
-Looking to buy a house within 12 months 

Expenses: 
Car (currently waiting for it to sell as I feel this is my first step)
-$401/month for 66 more months 

-Insurance - $276/month (have a 2nd car to drive to/from work that I will keep once the car with a note sells) - so insurance should drop as well. I'm thinking to about $120 or so. 

-Fuel: roughly $200-$225 a month give or take. 32mi each way to work. Nothing to really do about that 

-Student Loans: $307.77/month for 9 more years :(

-Credit Card Debt: 
2,078.17 - working on paying down. I am almost there. 

Savings: I'd like to save $1,000 a month while I can, but I'm being told I'm trying to oversave. Currently I am only saving $400 a month. Which I feel is not enough. What happens when you run into an emergency for 2k or so, that sets you back by 3 months. (This is all aside from retirement contributions).

When I sell my car, that will put a little over 5k into my savings from equity. I do not plan to pay my CC debt with that. I will keep paying from my checks. Out of sight out of mind. 

My other car has 127k miles and seems to be a great reliable car that could last many more years, but it's always a gamble. Worth roughly $7000-$7500. I own it. 

My question is, when I sell my first car, should I liquidate the 2nd car as well? With plans to replace it with something with lower mileage/newer? 

If I liquidated both vehicles, that'd put about 12k in my savings. 

But then I will need to replace it with another car. 

If this is the case, should I get a loan for something that has my payments no more than 300? I'm unsure whether to use that 12k to keep saving for when I move out or if I should use some of it for the newer car. 

The only issue with keeping the 2nd car, is it will eventually need to be replaced, just like any car, and I'd imagine that is when I'll have a mortgage in my name. 

I'm just trying to figure out my best path forward so I don't screw myself later on because once I move out, I feel as if I am not going to have a whole lot of money left over for myself or for savings - which I can't seem to stop thinking about. 

What is a recommended amount to save as well?

t3_gjfmb1,"No Credit, Less than Stellar Rental History, and No Job - How do I find an Apartment?","I'll start this off by saying that I'm not 100% sure if this is the space for this, so please point me in the right direction if it's not. And if it matters at all, I live around Long Beach, CA.

So my situation is this. I was furloughed from my part-time, barely-above-minimum-wage job recently due to the COVID pandemic. This is kind of okay for me, it gives me more time to do homework and the government is giving me WAY MORE money than I was originally making so I'm actually going to be saving money 5 times as fast as when I was working. Problem is, I'm at the point where I think it would be financially irresponsible for me to get a temporary full time job over the summer (which was my original plan before all this happened).

My second issue is that my rental history is not great. I'm still on a lease in San Francisco with my old roommates who refused to change the lease when I had to leave in July of last year. We never, ever had an issue with paying rent or bills on time while I lived there. But since moving out, they have paid the rent late multiple times AND no one currently has put the gas and electric bill in their name since I took mine off, so PG&amp;E has been sending the bill to collections since August, marring everyone's credit. There is nothing I can really do at this point, none of them will listen to me and the management company in charge of the old house will not let me out of the month to month lease unless everyone in the house either moves out or signs a new year-long lease, which my old roommates will not do. (Never move in with strangers you met on Craigslist, kids.)

My final issue is that I have no credit history other than the collections. I wasn't dumb enough to get a credit card as a teenager and it just never came up again until now. This was dumb and all my bad. I do, however, have over $10k saved up in the bank and will have over $12k at the end of the month.

However, the two friends that I am planning on moving in with do have good credit. One of them is over 600 and the other one is over 700. One with no rental history and just moving out of his parent's place and one has good rental history.

My main question is how do we go about this when I've fucked up so badly? Are we going to have to have a cosigner, and does that always mean we'll have to pay higher rent?

t3_gjfhc7,ELAN Financial services attacking my credit,"Hello,

I normally don't really check my credit because nothing is going on, I'm not looking for loans and haven't had the need to apply for credit in several years. I recently got a warning that my credit is negatively affected by an account listed as ELAN financial services (actually 90 days late). I immediately disputed it with the credit reporting agencies as I have never heard of ELAN, and assumed it is a scam of some sort.

I did also call a number for ELAN I could find on the web, but their phone system is horrible. I called countless times, and I get nowhere. I never received any communication by mail or phone from them either. They acknowledge that I have an account based on my social security which I begrudgingly gave one of these people, even though I feel like I was helping scammers, and my trust was immediately betrayed as after giving the person my ssn they promptly refused to give me any information in return (they cannot tell me anything about the account for security reasons, but now they got my SSN). They said that if I made a payment to them right then, they will talk to a supervisor about getting me the account number. I'm not falling for that. I asked them how they could possibly do this to me, and they said its because I have a ""converted account"". I don't know what that means. The amount of money they want is tiny (200 USD roughly), but I'm not about to be extorted/robbed for that. After that episode I reported this scam operation to the consumer protection agency here in CA.  


I guess now all I can do is wait. Are there any other steps I can take to get this cleared up? It insanely bothers me, that these people can do this to me, and I have no rights/means of control here.",personalfinance,elan financial service attacking credit,hello normally really check credit nothing going looking loan need apply credit several year recently got warning credit negatively affected account listed elan financial service actually day late immediately disputed credit reporting agency never heard elan assumed scam sort also call number elan could find web phone system horrible called countless time get nowhere never received communication mail phone either acknowledge account based social security begrudgingly gave one people even though feel like helping scammer trust immediately betrayed giving person ssn promptly refused give information return cannot tell anything account security reason got ssn said made payment right talk supervisor getting account number falling asked could possibly said converted account know mean amount money want tiny usd roughly extorted robbed episode reported scam operation consumer protection agency guess wait step take get cleared insanely bother people right mean control,elan financial service attacking credit  normally really check credit nothing going looking loan need apply credit several year recently got warning credit negatively affected account listed elan financial service actually day late immediately disputed credit reporting agency never heard elan assumed scam sort also call number elan could find web phone system horrible called countless time get nowhere never received communication mail phone either acknowledge account based social security begrudgingly gave one people even though feel like helping scammer trust immediately betrayed giving person ssn promptly refused give information return cannot tell anything account security reason got ssn said made payment right talk supervisor getting account number falling asked could possibly said converted account know mean amount money want tiny usd roughly extorted robbed episode reported scam operation consumer protection agency guess wait step take get cleared insanely bother people right mean control

t3_gjf8k7,Recent Grad Moving to NYC - Need Budgeting Help,"Hey all, I am a 2020 college grad who (assuming Corona doesn't change anything) will be moving to NYC in August to start a full time job. I'm looking to budget and will give all info below, please help out if you can.

Salary: $57,000 annual salary, OT eligible. Additional $3,000 paid in the first paycheck (not up front). I'm assuming after a 31% total tax rate I'll have in the ballpark of $3,270 per month, not inc. the bonus.

Savings: I'll be going into the move with about $8,000 in savings assuming I'll be able to get a part time job for the rest of the summer before the move. This plus the bonus (at 31% tax) gives me just over $10,000 liquid. I also have a $2,500 line of credit with zero current balance, and I'd rather use savings than credit to finance the move.

Expenses:
Rent: Looking at the housing market in NYC, I believe I can get a studio in the range of $1,250/ month without living in a shady area. I think $1350 (inc. utilities/ internet/ laundry) has to be my hard cap, and as much as I'm likely looking for something that doesn't exist, I'd like to be as close to work as possible and not have to deal with roommates. This may be better suited for a NYC sub, but is this all reasonable?

Student Loans: The absolute monkey wrench in all of this. I went to a larger school as a first generation student and financed it almost entirely on loans. Starting in December 2020 I'll be paying $1,265 per month for the foreseeable future. My parents have said they'll do a 2/3rds split (meaning I'll only pay $820) but I'd rather plan to pay the whole thing in case they back out.

Other Expenses: this is another part that I'm pretty clueless on. Is budgeting $400 a month for food fair? I'm a pretty good cook and can make do with lots of pasta/ chicken/ cheap veggies, but at the same time I'm a big guy and can certainly eat a fair amount if given the opportunity; fast food adds up quick. There's also the subway pass at $127/ mo, and other assorted expenses (amazon, other travel/ fun money, taking care of a small pet, etc.)

Adding it all up I understand that I'm very close to my monthly limit, and this is with zero savings, zero investment into retirement, and limited ""fun money."" I know the loans are a lot, and trust me I know what I signed up for in that regard. But from a strictly budgeting standpoint, does this all add up? Am I missing anything, being unrealistic with some numbers, is there anything I can do to gain more income?

t3_gj7cjw,"Should we speed up our move from CA &gt; NH in the next 30 days to save 22K in (sudden, windfall) capital gains taxes?","**(1) We've got a windfall coming in, in the next 30 days.** We bought some company stock options from a startup I worked at a few years ago. I now have a private buyer and the company looks ready to approve the transaction in the next 30 days. We should be clearing a (totally unexpected windfall) profit of nearly $360K.  I would say two months ago we thought the stock would be worthless, so this is a real unexpected boon.

**(2)If we change nothing, we will owe $104K in taxes on the $360K.  But We were already planning a relocation sometime this year to the Vermont/New Hampshire border from California.** We were starting to shop around for a mortgage and have done a lot of online looking. Have pretty much picked our community and were ready to do a visit. We haven't spent a lot of time in the area. Our original plan was to go for a Reconaissance trip once COVID restrictions eased, and probably buy in the summer and move in by fall.

Now we're wondering if we should speed up our move (during COVID) to see if we can avoid the California capital gains tax.

[This calculator](https://smartasset.com/investing/capital-gains-tax-calculator) says we will pay:

$103,880 in California  
$81,196 in New Hampshire  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
**$22,684 in Savings**  


**We are looking at a $22,684 savings if we relocate before the transaction goes through.** Is it worth it to take the risk on jumping across country in the next 30 days (and skip our reconnaissance period, etc. to save the tax money?)

**How do we de-risk a sudden move?** We were \*pretty sure\* we wanted to go to this area but really hoped to check it out more before we made things permanent. We haven't spent any time there yet, but have researched it extensively, checked out schools and housing, etc.

Questions:

* *Is the state that collects capital gains based on where you're living on the date of the transaction? What is the ""datestamp"" they look at to know if you get taxed in one state or another?*
* Could I just rent a new ""primary residence"" in New Hampshire for a few months, then we buy another residence later in the year (maybe in VT?), and have that be workable?

Details:

* Family of 4, annual income around $250K with fully remote job.
* Currently renting month-to-month in California at a high rental rate.
* Planning to buy our first home this year.
* We are in a good financial position generally, with 250K for our downpayment + other savings and healthy retirement and college funds set aside. ***We don't \*need\* the 22K, but hey, it's 22k.***",personalfinance,speed move next day save sudden windfall capital gain tax,got windfall coming next day bought company stock option startup worked year ago private buyer company look ready approve transaction next day clearing totally unexpected windfall profit nearly would say two month ago thought stock would worthless real unexpected boon change nothing owe tax already planning relocation sometime year vermont new hampshire border california starting shop around mortgage done lot online looking pretty much picked community ready visit spent lot time area original plan reconaissance trip covid restriction eased probably buy summer move fall wondering speed move covid see avoid california capital gain tax calculator say pay california new hampshire saving looking saving relocate transaction worth take risk jumping across country next day skip reconnaissance period etc save tax money risk sudden move pretty sure wanted area really hoped check made thing permanent spent time yet researched extensively checked school housing etc question state collect capital gain based living date transaction datestamp look know get taxed one state another could rent new primary residence new hampshire month buy another residence later year maybe workable detail family annual income around fully remote job currently renting month month california high rental rate planning buy first home year good financial position generally downpayment saving healthy retirement college fund set aside need hey ,speed move next day save sudden windfall capital gain tax got windfall coming next day bought company stock option startup worked year ago private buyer company look ready approve transaction next day clearing totally unexpected windfall profit nearly would say two month ago thought stock would worthless real unexpected boon change nothing owe tax already planning relocation sometime year vermont new hampshire border california starting shop around mortgage done lot online looking pretty much picked community ready visit spent lot time area original plan reconaissance trip covid restriction eased probably buy summer move fall wondering speed move covid see avoid california capital gain tax calculator say pay california new hampshire saving looking saving relocate transaction worth take risk jumping across country next day skip reconnaissance period etc save tax money risk sudden move pretty sure wanted area really hoped check made thing permanent spent time yet researched extensively checked school housing etc question state collect capital gain based living date transaction datestamp look know get taxed one state another could rent new primary residence new hampshire month buy another residence later year maybe workable detail family annual income around fully remote job currently renting month month california high rental rate planning buy first home year good financial position generally downpayment saving healthy retirement college fund set aside need

t3_gjeu8l,Left $19K on the table by messing up retirement election,"Going to keep this short. I'm sharing my story so others may learn from my mistake and because I just need to vent.

I've worked for pubic universities for the past 4 years. They offer teachers retirement (vested after 7 years) with long-term incentives and elective savings (vested in 3 years, match 8%).

At my first employer I opted for elective, knowing I likely wouldn't be there that long. At my second employer, I opted for the same - or so I thought.

Now, as I prepare to leave my employer in a month, I've realized that I've been both contributing to teachers retirement (7%) and two separate elective accounts (16% total).

Not only have I left free money on the table, I've been placing undue financial strain on myself these past 3 years, AND I'll be losing out on 100% of the employer-contributed funds from teachers retirement. 

I'm fairly passive in managing my retirement accounts, so I didn't notice this grave mistake until much too late.

t3_gjb7wv,Sell old house or rent? Are we crazy?,"Hi PF - throwaway here. 

Right before the pandemic, my wife and I bought another house that fit our needs better, and moved. Our old house is paid off - so we were able to take our time in moving. Right now it’s just sitting there, because we have a few things left to fix and haven’t been able to get over there easily. 

We could rent out the old house for \~$2000 (takehome $1500 after prop taxes and saving for repairs). 

But we really want to sell the house and take home about 300k. 

We both own our own companies and are freelancers in the live event/concert business, and work a lot with schools.

Because of COVID, we’ve lost all income for Q2, Q3 and possibly Q4.  
(Gov assistance is helping some)

We’re surviving mainly on business cash savings.

We do not want to take that $300k and put it on the new house because it wouldn’t cover all the new mortgage entirely, and we would still have a payment anyway each month.  

\-zero debt (aside from new house mortgage)  
\-$1500 a month mortgage on new house @ 4%  
\-including mortgage, about $5k/month expenses  
\-no kids (no plan for kids in the future)  
\-been living off of business cash savings reserves  
\-have 401k and 6 month emergency fund that we haven’t touched yet. 

So:

1. Are we crazy for wanting to sell the old house (instead of renting)?
2. Are we crazy to want to put most of the cash into a longterm managed investment account? (Instead of pay down new house)

The idea with investing is this:  
We did a managed account with Vanguard last year. We put in $100k, in Jan 2019 made $14k in 11 months, and used that $114k to put a downpayment on our new house.

Let’s say we sell the old house and take home $300k.    
I would want to put $200k in Vanguard and the remaining $100k would    
So, even if we only make 8% return in Vanguard, I feel like it’s an easier way to have cash quickly (even though it would be taxed) if we HAVE to pull it out for living expenses down the road. And if we don’t have to touch it, then it grows.

t3_gjekbw,"Apartment vs House in the fall, a financially good move?","So my finance and I have fought numerous of times of what we want come the fall since she really wants a house. I really want a house too but I don't think it's financially a good idea to buy one this year, I'd much rather move into an apartment and save up for at least 20% down to avoid mortgage insurance and allow us to start paying towards the principal instead of the interest. The problem is her parents have ingrained her decision that houses are end all be all, and that apartments are a waste of money. -\_- on the contrary to that I've done extensive research and see the pros and cons to both house and apartments but see the positive of how apartments can save money and allow us to work our way into living independently. I don't see the rush in purchasing a house, frankly I'd much rather avoid PMI, and paying towards interest during the first years of the home and just pay towards principal from the start. We plan to see a realtor in the fall but I don't know what to expect, I know they will show us that we can afford a house but idk since her job status is kind of inconsistent since she is a sub at the moment hoping to find a full time teaching position in the fall and hoping to make some side income during the summer working in a daycare. I don't think she realizes (correct me if I am wrong) but even if we see a realtor in the fall he will only consider my income since I will be able to prove I've been on my job for a year and a few months at that point and she would have been a long term sub for 6 months and had a full time teaching job at least a month or so.  (bonus she also wants to buy a used car too which is something I know your not supposed to do when being pre-qualified since we would be considered a higher risk client) If anyone wants to crunch the numbers for me, here are the stats

My salary = $60,000

Her projected salary = $30,000 - $55,0000

Total money saved from both of us combined  (By the fall) = \~$60,000

Projected downpayment amount = $20,000 ($10,000 from each of us)

&amp;#x200B;

Other things I didn't include are, that we are saving up for our honeymoon to the Poconos in April 2021 and a Cruise in June 2021. Total cost combined for both = \~$4,000 rough estimates (about $2,048 for cruise and \~$2,000 for Poconos) .

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me know what everyone thinks, trust me I made a post awhile back where most people said to make a spreadsheet which compares both apartment and house which she saw and started to hop onboard with the apartment with seeing the numbers but still doesn't want to believe we can't afford a house which is why we are seeing a realtor.....

t3_gj2l1s,New York Tax Withholding allowances - calculating correctly? (Trying to lower state/local tax to afford increased 401k contribution),"Hi all,

I am attempting to understand New York state and city withholding allowances. I am attempting to lower the amount of state and city taxes withheld from my paycheck so I can afford to increase my contributions to my 401k. 

2020 total salary: $100,000

Existing withholding allowances: 2 federal (I understand I can increase this on new W4 based on 401k contribution - this is more straightforward to me), 0 state, 0 new york city.

I have been using the New York tax form IT-2104 to figure this out. Link: [https://www1.nyc.gov/site/opa/taxes/determining-withholding-allowances.page](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/opa/taxes/determining-withholding-allowances.page)

For the final part of the exercise, in Part 5, line 35, the only applicable allowances to me come from the line 16: ""enter your adjustments to federable taxable income, such as deductible IRA contributions..."" 

For line 16, for example, I would put 15 if I anticipated contributing $15,000 to my 401k in 2020. Is this correct? This would mean I would claim 15 total allowances?

I believe I am doing something wrong because when I then used a separate calculator, it said the maximum # of allowances is 14?

I have two balance transfer offers available:

**Offer 1: 0% APR (12 months), 5% Transfer Fee**

**Offer 2: 6.99% APR (15 months), 0% Transfer Fee**

If I transfer $10,000 with the first offer I will pay a $500 flat transfer fee, making the total payoff amount $10,500 over 12 months which would require a minimum payment of $875/month to pay off the amount by the end of the introductory period.

Is my math wrong? Why wouldn't I choose offer 2? This also gives me the option of paying more per month and paying less interest the sooner I pay it off.

t3_gjdpl8,Student loan refinance application rejected. Why?,"Hello, I recently graduated from college and decided to apply for refinancing of my student loans due to the current rates. Some background on my situation:

* I graduated last month and made sure to wait until all my grades came in to verify I graduated
* I luckily have a job secured that pays very well and allows me extra money to pay towards loans
* I only applied to have my private loans (approx. $25k) refinanced

I had to jump through a few hoops to prove I graduated and to verify my income but throughout the process my advisor at the loan company didn't raise any issues about my eligibility for a loan. I recently got an email saying that I was denied due to information they received from a credit reporting agency. The thing is, my credit score is really good (770). I have been building credit for the past 4 years with a credit card that I have never missed a payment on. I have also been making additional payments to my student loans while I was in school.

&amp;#x200B;

Would anyone know why my application could have been rejected? ~~They're saying they won't tell me specifically why.~~

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Their letter to me says that I ""did not meet program requirements"" followed by a description that consulting credit agencies partially or entirely resulted in their decision to deny me. Any idea what this means?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 2: I dove deeper on the student loan provider's website. These are their eligibility requirements for refinancing:

* Must be US citizen or Permanent Resident (I am)
* Must be age of majority or older (I am)
* Must have minimum loan amount of $15000 (I do)
* Must have earned a bachelor's degree or higher (I did)
* Must have minimum income of $35000 (I do)
* Must have minimum credit score of 680 (I do)
* Must have a minimum credit history of 36 months (I do)
* Must have a degree from an approved institution (I do according to their website)

t3_gj96k2,Taxes as a full-time student,"Forgive me if this is just a google search, but I am having a hard time understanding my taxes. First some background. I am a full time college student and the only income I have is from my student research which was $3500 in 2019. I have never filed my taxes before since my parents always sent it through their accountant. I told my parents I would like to start filing on my own so I can better understand how to do my own taxes since I won't likely use an accountant out of school. My dad gave me all my tax papers that came to the house. He has told me multiple times that I don't even need to file. I watched the khan academy course on taxes and personal finance as well as did some poking around on the IRS website. After doing that I thought maybe I should file my taxes. Am I wrong? My understanding is that since I made $3500 and I am claimed as a dependent, my standard deduction is $1100 and I pay in the 10% bracket on the rest. For clarification, my research money was a stipend so I filled out a W9 and recieved a 1099-MISC at the end of the year. Am I going about this the right way or am I wasting my time and money?

Also, I'm not sure how to deal with the tuition form I got. My parents have been helping me with tuition so I'm not sure how to report that.

t3_gjd0u6,Housing for the Upcoming Year,"Hello, all I am trying to figure out my situation for living for this next year and was wondering all of your advice. 

Basically, my girlfriend and I are talking about getting married in December or May. When we do, this will be the start of us living together (we won't until we do get married and we do want to have an actual wedding as much as we can with all that is going on). She is a student and has 1 year left and I am graduated and working full-time.

Essentially I am deciding to live with someone else and split the rent or live alone. It would be about $400 splitting but about $700-800+ on my own. To preface, I have a job where I make enough to support myself well. I make roughly $3400 a month after taxes. Right now I am probably paying $450 for everything in total.

If I choose to live alone, I am ready for either decision we make on when to get married. She can always just move into where I will be living. However, we may not end up getting married until May then I would basically be living alone until then and having to pay more money. She would come over, but I do not know how well that would end up working out for my own mental health and just finances in general managing it all.

The other option is I get a place with my friend and me until we get married. However, after we get married I will have to find someone to sublease me when I move out. When she moves out, we have to pay $300 off her rent a month until the lease ends next July. If we get married in December, I will have to find someone to sublease and we will have to find a place to live for 6 months until she graduates as we may move after that point. If I can't find a sublease,  that would be an extra $400 a month I would have to pay on top of my new rent and my GF's $300. And we would have to find a place with only like a 3-month lease. If we get married in May or summerish, I would move out and we would have to find a place only for the summer or we would have to move into the place I was already living until we knew where we would be for the next year, or I could ask my roommate to move home for a few months but I do not know if he would do that. It would just be a really hard situation.

Basically, if I move in with someone, we have a lot more things that we need to end up figuring out. But I could save a lot more money to help pay for a wedding over those months, regardless of when we decide to get married if I move in with someone.

What do I do with this? I cannot continue to dump money into this house and I do not have 16K to pay off the balloon.

t3_gj8934,Original house sale price listed as $1. Do we have options?,"Hi /r/personalfinance,

Back in the 1950's my grandma bought a house. I believe she owned the house. She lived in it until 2001, when my mom and I moved in. My mom currently lives there. This year, I would like to buy the house from my mom so she can move in with her boyfriend and retire. 

The issue is, according to county tax records, my mom only paid $1 for the house when she took it from my grandma in 2001. I can't figure it out. Back then, it was valued at ~$150K. It is currently valued at ~$500K, which is around what I will offer her for it.

I don't know why it was recorded as $1, but now I'm very concerned that my mom will be taxed unnecessarily for this sale, when that $1 figure does not represent the value of the house at the time of sale. My mom currently has a $200K mortgage on it, which she took out in 2016.

I heard that if you call them directly and just keep asking for a manager you can eventually pay back capital one itself as opposed to paying it via collections and then maybe it will not get scrubbed from your record. Just wondering if this holds any truth or if there's a better method of doing this which is paying back in full what I owe either with interest or without.

t3_gjc904,Misfiled F2555 with late taxes,"Hello everyone,

So I think I really messed up on filling my back taxes. 

I filled on time for 2015, my first year partially in Japan, as I had some income from part time jobs That I worked in the US. However, I didn’t end up owing anything thanks to claiming the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion, and that US income not being too much. 


After that, since I had no US income, and I thought my income would effectively be zero due to the FEIE, I didn’t file for three years. 

 Recently, with COVID 19 and stimulus checks, I decided to look into the laws, and realized that even with the FEIE, I obviously still need to file every year.

I panicked and filed out and mailed all three of my late years returns by paper, including the FEIE in each. What I didn’t however do was write the statement “Filed Pursuant to Section 1.911-7(a)(2)(i)(D)” on any of them. I didn’t realize it was necessary at the time because the wording of this [webpage](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/choosing-the-foreign-earned-income-exclusion) for the F2555 made it seem like that was only necessary if I would owe taxes, and I don’t earn too much (~36-37k usd at most per year).

My question is, is there anything I can do to amend that error? Or is there any way that I could still keep the FEIE despite that small and very possibly critical error?

Sorry for the rant, I’m extra stressed with the current situation, as I’m sure you all are too, in addition to my current predicament. And being in limbo due to paper returns not being processes is not helping. 

P.S. if anyone who has made the same mistake has any advice, that would also be greatly welcome.",personalfinance,misfiled late tax,hello everyone think really messed filling back tax filled time first year partially japan income part time job worked however end owing anything thanks claiming foreign earned income exclusion income much since income thought income would effectively zero due feie file three year recently covid stimulus check decided look law realized even feie obviously still need file every year panicked filed mailed three late year return paper including feie however write statement filed pursuant section realize necessary time wording webpage made seem like necessary would owe tax earn much usd per year question anything amend error way could still keep feie despite small possibly critical error sorry rant extra stressed current situation sure addition current predicament limbo due paper return process helping anyone made mistake advice would also greatly welcome,misfiled late tax  everyone think really messed filling back tax filled time first year partially japan income part time job worked however end owing anything thanks claiming foreign earned income exclusion income much since income thought income would effectively zero due feie file three year recently covid stimulus check decided look law realized even feie obviously still need file every year panicked filed mailed three late year return paper including feie however write statement filed pursuant section realize necessary time wording webpage made seem like necessary would owe tax earn much usd per year question anything amend error way could still keep feie despite small possibly critical error sorry rant extra stressed current situation sure addition current predicament limbo due paper return process helping anyone made mistake advice would also greatly welcome

t3_gjc4my,My College Just Gave Me a Check and I Don't Know What to think of It,"Hi, so I'm lost.

My college which is a small private school just gave out checks to the students that attend the school and from talking to my friends it sounds like its a needs-based amount check. (the amount has ranged from $100-1000 depending on the person.) Also, this is different from the school reimbursement of housing, etc because that happened earlier in the year.

Anyway, from what I can gather, I think it is coming from a grant that my school got from the CARES Act because the check is in the name of my college.

If anyone is knowledgeable in the CARES Act and college money is there restrictions on my use of the money? It came with a note from my school saying it's for added expenses due to not being on campus such as rent, food, technology, child care, and health care. Does this mean that I can't use the check for tuition next fall (my current plan) how would my school track how I spend the money (since it came from my school NOT the government.)

If anyone knows what this is about or how to handle the check, or even has a place where I can research it and find out more info please c=let me know about it because I didn't ask for or sign up for this money but it will help me greatly.

I received a ""Notice of Assignment to a Collection Agency"" letter for a toll violation. The notice date is Apr 24 and the issue date is Jan 7.

t3_gj219w,Merchant charged me 3 times with a card on file without my permission for $4500,"I purchased something from a merchant in the industry I work with for ($2200). It is not uncommon in this industry for merchants to keep your card on file for future payments. Two weeks after the first purchase, I noticed another charge for $1500 from this merchant. I called them asked them what was going on and they claimed it was a mistake that a new employee made and that they would refund the money. I waited a couple weeks to see the refund in my account and saw nothing. Two weeks later, two more charges from this same merchant for $1500 each, so at this point $4500 in unapproved charges. He said he had initiated the refund and was waiting for it to clear but at this point I didn't believe a word this guy was saying so I reached out to my bank, Chase, and told them that I wanted to chargeback these three purchases as I had never approved them. This was all back in January.

Chase credited me the money while this was happening and it just showed on my statement as a reversal of the original charge so I assumed this was taken care of. Fast forward three months and I wake up to all three charges back on my card statement which closes in 4 days. I called the merchant and he insists that he never fought the disputes, and showed me emails through square showing that he accepted them. However he literally filmed himself in his gmail account and I saw another dispute in there for $2000 that had the exact same thing going on. Somehow, Chase still sided with him and Square and now I need to send Chase an email to potentially open up the chargeback again.

I'm terrified that I somehow was scammed and it seems completely insane that this is possible when credit cards are supposed to have buyer protection for reasons exactly like this. He is somewhat responsive when I contact him and keeps insisting that he's doing what he can to get me my money back but after doing some more in-depth research on the business it seems like he has a history of scamming people out of a good amount of money.

Yet, I'm hesitant because of all the buzz about a massive loan forgiveness bill for Americans. I'd hate to give them the $26k just to learn later had I not, I could have had no loans and kept the money in my own pocket.

t3_gjbxid,Using extended repayment plans and avalanche method to pay less over life of student loans?,"I graduated in December 2018 and currently have about 44k in student loans. I have 8 loans with interest rates ranging from about 3.85% - 5.1%. I’m currently on the standard repayment plan, and my payments are about $450/mo, which we can afford, but I’m considering different repayment options to try to take advantage of the different interest rates to pay less over the life of the loans. This would basically involve switching to either the Extended Fixed (EF) or Extended Graduated (EG) Repayment Plan, which would increase the term of the loans from 10 years to 25 years and decrease my minimum monthly payments. Under EF my payment would be reduced to $227/mo and under EG my payments would start at $151/mo and ramp up to $392/mo.


I would make the minimum payments on all of the loans, except for the one with the highest interest rate. I would apply any money saved from my payment reduction (and maybe apply an extra $50 - $100 each month) to pay off the highest interest loan first and then avalanche that money into the next highest interest rate loan and so on. I know that I need to check with my loan servicer first to find out if additional money over the payment amount can be applied to the principle. If this isn’t the case, then I will use either a savings account or a money market account to save up and pay off the loan once I have enough.


Is there some reason why I shouldn’t do this though? Are there hidden fees with switching payment plans? Are there other disadvantages to doing this that I may not be considering?

t3_gjbsuz,To Buy a New Fuel Efficient Car or Not?,"I would like some input on if I should buy a new fuel efficient car or not. I have posted the math in a Google Docs Spreadsheet below. This is a quick back of napkin type calculation so its nowhere near perfect.

Some background info:

I just started a new job that requires me to drive a total of 90 miles per day. I currently drive a 2001 Nissan Frontier. It currently does not have working AC. (I live in the southeast US so it gets toasty during summer). I have been mulling over the idea of getting a new, more fuel efficient car that has all the bells and whistles to make my commute more enjoyable. The 2017 Hyundai Sonata Limited Hybrid was the car I was looking at based on reviews and having friends who like their Sonatas. I assumed no car loan interest and maintenance/insurance/registrations would be equal. From my math (please tell me if I am wrong) it would take almost 5.5 years to break even on the difference to do some maintenance and fix my AC on my Frontier vs buying the Sonata.

Spreadsheet Number Breakdown:

Miles/Day: how many miles I drive to and from work

Gas Price/Gallon: current gas prices in my area

Upfront Cost: cost to fix some things on the Frontier and price of the Sonata

MPG: average miles per gallon taken from the US Department of Energy website

Cost/Day: ((Miles/Day) / (MPG)) \* (Gas Price/Gallon)

Days to Break Even: ((Upfront Cost Sonata) - (Upfront Cost Frontier)) / ((Cost/Day Fronter) - (Cost/Day Sonata))

t3_gjblf9,How much house can I really afford?,"All the affordability calculators are giving me numbers that seem absurdly high, so I’m hoping to get a more realistic opinion.  
  
* **Annual income**: $180k base before taxes. Potential annual bonus of $70k before taxes, highly dependent on company performance, so let’s call it $0.  
* **401(k) contributions**: $19,500  
* **Monthly take home**: $9100  
* **Debt**: None.  I currently don’t have a car payment, but for this I’d like to assume I’ll have one of, say $400/mo.  
* **Other expenses:** Just typical food and utilities.  I do eat out much more than I should.  
* **Down payment:** By the time I would want to buy, I could probably swing a $100k down payment and still have a 6-month emergency fund left over.  
* **Credit**: 800+  
* **Other info:** 40, not married and not planning on it anytime soon.  Los Angeles area.  
  
Based on this, how much house can I afford without being house poor, while still being able to save a good chunk post-tax for retirement?  
  
Does it even make financial sense for a single dude to buy a single family home?  Or would I be better off buying a cheaper apartment/condo/townhome and investing the difference?  
  
I do have a couple of hobbies that aren’t super apartment/condo/townhome friendly, but I’m not sold on that being a good enough reason by itself to buy a house.  
 
My main goal is to not be homeless when I’m older.  Other than that, I don’t need a lot of money to spend on random stuff.  I have pretty simple tastes.

t3_gjbhte,Is moving to a new city with only 7-8K saved a feasible achievement?,"So here's my situation.

I'm miserable. I live in a city that I have no connections in with no friends and nothing to do because it's in the middle of bumfck nowhere. I'm only here because I graduated college last year and had to move back in with my parents.  Since around last fall, I've been saving up by working minimum wage jobs, and have now around 6.5K in savings. I'm looking to make that 8K come july.

I want to move desperately. I'm 23 and want to experience life in a place where there are things to do and people my age to hang out with and find an SO to build a life with. But I just feel like that's impossible to do because I am unable to get work experience in any field besides minimum wage because of where I live, and because now we have this Covid Crisis going on. I'm planning to wait out until July, but once I have that 8k I plan to book it somewhere else.

My plan is to get a cheap air n b place for 1 month, and look for a roomshare situation on craigslist as well as some jobs while staying there. I'm looking to move to a city that has a large workforce market so that I can apply for things that aren't retail. The only debt I have is a car payment that is around 300$ a month, which my parents have offered to cover for me until I land on my feet.

But I'm scared to make the jump. Both because I don't know when the country will open back up, and because I've been told moving without a job lined up is generally an awful idea.

The other problem, however, is that my parents have told me there is a possibility they will be moving overseas this fall anyway, which means I might be forced into this situation anyway.

The two main cities I'm looking at at the moment are cities in the Valley of California, Wake County in North Carolina, and the suburbs of Chicago. I have family I can stay with in NC and Chicago Suburbs, but Sacramento is my top choice.",personalfinance,moving new city saved feasible achievement,situation miserable live city connection friend nothing middle bumfck nowhere graduated college last year move back parent since around last fall saving working minimum wage job around saving looking make come july want move desperately want experience life place thing people age hang find build life feel like impossible unable get work experience field besides minimum wage live covid crisis going planning wait july plan book somewhere else plan get cheap air place month look roomshare situation craigslist well job staying looking move city large workforce market apply thing retail debt car payment around month parent offered cover land foot scared make jump know country open back told moving without job lined generally awful idea problem however parent told possibility moving overseas fall anyway mean might forced situation anyway two main city looking moment city valley california wake county north carolina suburb chicago family stay chicago suburb sacramento top choice,moving new city saved feasible achievement situation miserable live city connection friend nothing middle bumfck nowhere graduated college last year move back parent since around last fall saving working minimum wage job around saving looking make come july want move desperately want experience life place thing people age hang find build life feel like impossible unable get work experience field besides minimum wage live covid crisis going planning wait july plan book somewhere else plan get cheap air place month look roomshare situation craigslist well job staying looking move city large workforce market apply thing retail debt car payment around month parent offered cover land foot scared make jump know country open back told moving without job lined generally awful idea problem however parent told possibility moving overseas fall anyway mean might forced situation anyway two main city looking moment city valley california wake county north carolina suburb chicago family stay chicago suburb sacramento top choice

t3_gjbd0u,I have some debt issues and could really use a point in the right direction.,"Need some advice.

Recently been dealing with some sweaty choices in which I don’t know what to do....

I have two credit cards (basically maxed) and two loans 
To which has the following details:

Loan 1: owing 3860 @39.9 interest
Loan 2: owing 2820 @36.9 interest
Credit card 1: owing 2800ish @29.9 Interest 
Credit card 2: owing 949 @21.9 interest 

It seems and has been near by impossible to get out of this difficult time..

I have a 9 month old daughter and I’m trying really hard to make the right choices..

I called my bank about debt consolidation and was rejected based on my high 400 credit score..

I’ve talked to an advisor and I’m still totally unsure what to do...

I’ve considered taking out a bigger loan that would clear out all those debts previously mentioned.

I’ve also been told maybe I should do a consumer proposal which in sense makes me credit worse before it gets better meaning I don’t pay those companies it’s full cost just most of it, but I want everything gone without credit getting worse...

If I can get any time of advice that would be greatly appreciated.


Edited with updated info.

I currently do not have any “emergency savings” or investments to which I tried to get into before but the lack of cash flow I had (based on all the interest) I didn’t have much or much extra to put towards that...

In a month on average I will get 2800/month... after monthly expenses I would have about 1200 left.. but after making constant payments towards loans and credit cards there’s not much to show.",personalfinance,debt issue could really use point right direction,need advice recently dealing sweaty choice know two credit card basically maxed two loan following detail loan owing interest loan owing interest credit card owing ish interest credit card owing interest seems near impossible get difficult time month old daughter trying really hard make right choice called bank debt consolidation rejected based high credit score talked advisor still totally unsure considered taking bigger loan would clear debt previously mentioned also told maybe consumer proposal sense make credit worse get better meaning pay company full cost want everything gone without credit getting worse get time advice would greatly appreciated edited updated info currently emergency saving investment tried get lack cash flow based interest much much extra put towards month average get month monthly expense would left making constant payment towards loan credit card much show,debt issue could really use point right direction need advice recently dealing sweaty choice know two credit card basically maxed two loan following detail loan owing interest loan owing interest credit card owing ish interest credit card owing interest seems near impossible get difficult time month old daughter trying really hard make right choice called bank debt consolidation rejected based high credit score talked advisor still totally unsure considered taking bigger loan would clear debt previously mentioned also told maybe consumer proposal sense make credit worse get better meaning pay company full cost want everything gone without credit getting worse get time advice would greatly appreciated edited updated info currently emergency saving investment tried get lack cash flow based interest much much extra put towards month average get month monthly expense would left making constant payment towards loan credit card much show

t3_gj73i5,Rent vs Sell my condo,"I currently live in a condo(paid-off), and plan to expand into a house in the next 1-2 years to support my growing family.  
I need help figuring out what numbers or considerations I should be looking at when deciding whether to sell or rent out my current Condo.

My goals are ease of mind, while still not heavily affecting my retirement savings(50% there).

Here's a few numbers.  
Condo costed me **$170k**, would sell for **$200k**(minus $10k for fees).  
Rent in my area is **$1600**. But I have the following monthly costs:  
$320/month HOA fees, $390/month property tax, $20/month insurance. 

New house price target is **$400k**(I have 20% saved up).

**My options are:**

1. Rent out the Condo, and use the $800 cash flow towards the payment of the new house.
2. Sell the condo, use the $190k as a down payment, to lower the house's monthly payments.
3. Sell the condo, invest the $190k in the S&amp;P500.
4. Sell the condo and sell some stocks, buy house with no mortgage payments.

t3_gj4f8e,"Not happy in my field, what do I do?","Hi r/personalfinance \- 

Apologies if this isn't the appropriate sub for this. Please let me know if that's the case.

I'm 27 and 4(ish) years into my career (5 if you count part time work before graduation). I've worked at a few different places in my field at this point and have realized it's not my ""forever field"" if that makes sense. Around about a year in, I get tired of the job and move on to somewhere else. The problem is, I don't want to leave my current job just to go to another job and have the same thing happen. 

I think the main thing I have realized is that sitting at a desk for 40-45 hrs/wk is not my cup of tea. None of my hobbies outside of work involve being still, so why would my career? My hobbies are woodworking, gardening, and vehicle restoration. However, I'm not good enough to make any of these a well paying career. I have realized that I like being in motion and I like working with my hands. 

So...how did you switch fields for people who have? I make \~$50k per year and wouldn't be too happy taking a massive pay cut. I am currently paying of high-interest debt while I build my savings, so I don't have a substantial savings built up to where I could just leave. 

I realize this may not be the best economic environment to do this in, so I will likely stay put until I have something else secured. Just looking for options right now. 

Have you ever switched career paths? Where did you switch from and where did you go? How did you handle it financially? How old were you when you did it. 

Would love any advice from folks who have done this and are wiser than I.

t3_gjbb61,No record of mailed tax return after eight weeks. Can I e-file instead?,"I am due for a decent tax refund this year. I physically mailed in my tax return on March 20th to the local branch of the treasury department using the address and labeling info provided by TurboTax. I chose not to e-file at the time because I did not have all of the requisite information, namely my 2018 tax return, which I now have access to. 

I have physically mailed in previous tax returns and, until this year, have received my refund promptly. The fact that my return was not returned to sender would seem to indicate that the USPS was able to successfully deliver the return, so there should not have been any issues with the address or postage. 

The IRS states that I should wait 6-8 weeks before the refund posts to my account. This is now the end of week 8. The ""Get Refund Status"" page on IRS.gov still seems to indicate that they have not received my request for my refund. I mailed the return again about three weeks later after I mailed the first one just be sure. Again, no change on the website. I understand that it may take some time for the refund to post to my bank account but I would at least expect the ""Get Refund Status"" page to show that they have a record of receiving the return by this point in time. 

I have not received any written correspondence from the IRS so it doesn't seem like there should be anything holding up the return (e.g. an audit). 

Everyone I know who chose to e-file received their refunds promptly after filing.  So I guess my questions are:

- Is there some sort of delay in processing tax returns, specifically physical tax returns, that I'm not aware of?
- Is there an option for me to somehow ""cancel"" my mailed-in refund request and instead choose to e-file?
- Will e-filing my tax return screw things up later? I don't want to e-file unless I'm certain that the mailed-in tax won't mess things up down the line.

t3_gjb5oh,Father pressing me to buy my stock options.. not sure if best decision.,"Hi all, 

First of all I want to thank you all for existing. You've been a major step forward for me in my finances!

Ok, now here's the issue I'm facing. My father is pressing me to purchase my startup stock options. 

He believes the company might be being sold. I won't give too much detail on the company, but they have basically gotten consistent investment for years and are still pre-profit. 

In my opinion, maybe out of kool-aid drinking. I believe the company has the potential to succeed, and do truly believe in it becoming one of the larger market share holders. 

BUT we're still pre-profit &amp; from my understanding pre-proof of concept, and in my mind, no where near being bought out. (Which is what my father seems to think will happen soon)

There are investors checking us out, which I have not witnessed before. However, I assume we're just getting more investors. Not so much being bought. 

I will be maxing out my Roth IRA soon, and will have some extra money to invest.

1. Is my dad right about putting my eggs in my company? 

2.Will acquiring another investor decrease the value of my stock options?

3. Or am I right to think I can invest down the line where 'proof of business' and profit have been accomplished?

I am 24 and I currently make 130k a year or 160k after bonus. I have been living in a shared house paying $1,600 in rent but I am getting kicked out in the next couple months because the owners want to move back into their home. This is unfortunate but I feel like I might be in a good enough place financially to finally rent my own apartment. I'm also looking forward to having my own place as I have had roommates since I was 17 years old in college. Even more unfortunate is that I live in Bay Area where rent is ridiculous. I am looking at studios for $2-2.2k. So after utilities I could be paying let's say $2,300 for living expenses.

Currently have a 6 month emergency fund sitting in a high interest savings account  
About 30k invested in retirement across 401k and Roth IRA (have to do backdoor this year).  
10k Car Note @ 2.99% interest  
I contribute 6% to my 401k to get the matching and max out my Roth IRA. I was planning on increasing to about 10%  
No major expenses coming up that I wouldn't be able to cover with cash or plans for further education

Budget outside of living expenses:  
Net Monthly Income after 401k, Insurance, and maxing IRA is $6,000 (before bonus. bonus is additional unbudgeted money for me)

I have a retirement model built out and my soft goal is to retire by 46. I did the math and if I were to save that additional $700 a month I would spend on rent for 3 years in the market, with 7% compounding interest it would be \~100k when I turn 46 (someone check my math), which I guess would shave a lot of time towards that goal, however how long am I supposed to keep living in a house with strangers where I feel uncomfortable bringing guests and partners over? Until I'm 27? 30? I really don't enjoy that outlook.

t3_gj3sgj,Best way to approach medical debt in collections?,"I have about $500 of medical debt in collections. I was actually genuinely confused why, because I felt I paid roughly $1100 for an emergency room visit in full. 3-4 months later I got a bill for roughly $500 for the same visit. Confused, I sat on it and honestly forgot and now it's in collections. 

I've seen many posts regarding requesting verification, and negotiating these bills with the collectors, but before I pick up the phone and say the wrong thing, I'd like some advice. I have not yet requested verification (still under 30 days of notice) and it has not shown on up any credit bureaus. 

What are the best steps I can take to accomplish the following:
1) No / minimal impact to credit 
2) Pay the least possible

t3_gjar1j,The last beast to conquer in getting my credit in order... a tuition bill in collections,"Hello, hope everyone is safe. Thanks in advance for reading or engaging! Long story to ask a simple question related to collections agencies so anyone with experience or knowledge with this let me know what you’ve dealt with or any advice. 

In the last 2 years I’ve had a reliable and good paying job. Now I’m ready to buy a home but I need to bring my credit up. I paid small medical bills I had let go in to collections (I don’t know some times these things just happen in your young adulthood). 

But now I have to pay the tuition from my last semester at a university when I dropped out without making any payments. 2 years ago I made payments to a collection agency so the school would release my transcript to my new school, but I never finished paying. 

So presently there is a new collection agency handling this. First call to them at the end of April they say they can submit a settlement offer to the school but it needs to be 75-80% of the amount. I can’t do that amount, and no time to do payment plans because I need to move ASAP.

I call them today to see if they will do a lower offer than that threshold. I offer pretty low like 30% just to start. The guy says typically 50% is where the settlement offer starts. That sounds pretty good but before I can even engage with the guy the line starts breaking up terribly and this guy transfers me.

 Now new guy says 70-80% is the lowest offer he will send to the school. I argue with him for a while for him to just send a lower offer. He won’t budge at about 62%. I tell him the other guy said 50% and he says he will have to review the call. 

So specifically, what is the reason why they can’t just send a low ball offer? It’s up to the school to decide if they will accept the amount so why can’t they just send any number I say? And also, how can I know what the true lower limit for sending an offer is? I want them to admit it could be as low as 50% so can I get them to send me the transcript from that conversation?",personalfinance,last beast conquer getting credit order tuition bill collection,hello hope everyone safe thanks advance reading engaging long story ask simple question related collection agency anyone experience knowledge let know dealt advice last year reliable good paying job ready buy home need bring credit paid small medical bill let collection know time thing happen young adulthood pay tuition last semester university dropped without making payment year ago made payment collection agency school would release transcript new school never finished paying presently new collection agency handling first call end april say submit settlement offer school need amount amount time payment plan need move asap call today see lower offer threshold offer pretty low like start guy say typically settlement offer start sound pretty good even engage guy line start breaking terribly guy transfer new guy say lowest offer send school argue send lower offer budge tell guy said say review call specifically reason send low ball offer school decide accept amount send number say also know true lower limit sending offer want admit could low get send transcript conversation,last beast conquer getting credit order tuition bill collection  hope everyone safe thanks advance reading engaging long story ask simple question related collection agency anyone experience knowledge let know dealt advice last year reliable good paying job ready buy home need bring credit paid small medical bill let collection know time thing happen young adulthood pay tuition last semester university dropped without making payment year ago made payment collection agency school would release transcript new school never finished paying presently new collection agency handling first call end april say submit settlement offer school need amount amount time payment plan need move asap call today see lower offer threshold offer pretty low like start guy say typically settlement offer start sound pretty good even engage guy line start breaking terribly guy transfer new guy say lowest offer send school argue send lower offer budge tell guy said say review call specifically reason send low ball offer school decide accept amount send number say also know true lower limit sending offer want admit could low get send transcript conversation
t3_gjapk6,Bank closed my card w/o notice,"Hello, I am a student who's trying to use this stay at home time trying to get his finances in order as best as possible especially after I had someone try to use one of my CC recently w/o my knowledge. I was hoping to get some advice here because I am still learning about finance on my own. 

I have been with 5/3 as my main bank for over a decade and basically have just used a checking account there. It was my first bank and the closest one to my house. So no problems really, but I did get a recent alert through my credit monitoring app that I had closed my 5/3 credit card (cc) account last week. Problem is I did not cancel my 5/3 credit card, I called 5/3 and they did it last week without alerting me (0$ balance on it). I was quite surprised since none of my 5/3 cards expire until 2021 so I dont know why they just chose to do it out of the blue. I am not the best at accounting, so I checked my transunion credit report and things seem fine so I am also asking here.

Also I saw my credit score dip 28 pts (pictured below) and on creditwise it was 48 pts lower in a day https://imgur.com/a/B6VNg8n


Questions:

A) If a bank closes one of your accounts with or without your knowledge can your credit score fall like 48 points in a day? How does this even work?

B) 5/3 asked me if I wanted to reopen the credit card (which I dont use), will this help raise my score back up?

C) What are some tips to raise my credit score back up since I've always tried to be careful with every dollar I spend. I have about $2500 balance on a 0% APR AMEX card and $5000 balance 8% APR on a capital one card I've had for over 10 years. Should I dip into my checking account (wanted to keep a balance here in case of emergency during these times) to pay these down?

D) I've been with 5/3 for a long time but I just felt the communication hasn't been that great from them and can't even recall ever getting alerts through mail, phone, or their online portal. What is the safest way to change my bank which includes 2 checking accounts, a savings account, since I have never worked with any other bank before?

E) Any easy to read materials for a novice who doesnt know much about finance to learn?

t3_gjanpn,My dad wants to withdraw his 401k and would like some assistance with that.,"So pretty much, he wants to withdraw his 401k retirement savings because he is afraid that there will be another wave of the virus and the market will be impacted again. He is currently 1.5 years away from retirement and he can already withdraw his saving without a penalty other than a federal tax. Personally, I suggested to keep it there until he retires. My view is that the economy will get better by that time. I also suggested, if he wants to go ahead and take out, I could make a savings account with my credit union from work which pays 1.5-2% dividends. What do you guys think? any suggestions are welcome. 

Also, he called the company where he confirmed that he wouldn't have any penalties for taking out, and asked if he would still have to report it to the IRS during the tax season and they told him they didn't know and only the tax preparer would let him know. do you guys know if he still has to report if he takes out and if that will affect him? 

What is usually the difference between taking out at 60 vs 62. I know I've heard before it's optimal to take out at 62. 

Thank you for the help!

EDIT: thanks guys! I figured taking out right now would not be convenient  and which I tried to tell my dad. I am currently looking into trying to change those investments to a more stable portfolio.

t3_gjaj8k,Student loan repayment strategy question,"Hi, r/personalfinance. I have a (potentially dumb) question regarding loan repayment strategies. I have a significant amount of student loan debt that I'm pretty sure I'll be able to handle just fine (job starting in the fall, thankfully), but I want to make sure I pay it all off optimally. I looked at the PF wiki for loan repayment, which only mentioned the avalanche and snowball methods. I get that the snowball method might be helpful for some people, but I think the avalanche method will work best for me--that is, at least in principle.

For some background: I have several loan ""groups"" varying in interest rates (\~3.5–7.8%) and in ""current payoff"" balances (\~$3k–23k). The avalanche method is described in the wiki as ""paying off the highest interest loans first.""

I am wondering if the avalanche method means that I should still direct all my payments toward the loans with the highest interests, even if their current payoff balances (which I gather are the principals + already-accrued interest) are lower than other loans. To make things more concrete, would it make more sense to pay off Loan A with a $26k balance at 6% or Loan B with a $17k balance at 7%? Obviously, Loan A will accrue more interest over the next year or so than Loan B, which makes me question whether the avalanche method's directive is universally applicable.

I'm guessing that it (at least) partially depends on the time it would take for me to pay off the loans  and go on to the next ones, so is there a way for me to make this kind of calculation based on my income/the portion of my income that I'm confident I'll be able to direct toward my student loans? I haven't been able to find any kind of online calculator that is capable of going into such specific details—if there is one out there that I missed, a link would be deeply appreciated.

t3_gja5ne,Advice on whether home ownership is feasible.,"My spouse and I live in a very expensive metropolitan area in the US — one of the top three or four nationally. Our combined annual base income is about $150k before taxes. However, my total gross income can fluctuate upward wildly. Like, last year I made $300k. The year before that I made about $200k. (The fluctuation is due to bonuses I get from my job — my base salary without bonuses is $100k). 

By the end of this year my spouse and I will have saved about $300k to purchase a home. It’ll be our first home. We’ve always rented till now. But in this area, the types of houses we are interested in owning range from $900,000 on the low end to like $2 million on the (reasonable) upper end. The houses we most like and would be willing to live in are typically about $1.25 million. 

Obviously we can’t afford a $2 million dollar home. That’s not my question. My question is — from everything described above, is home ownership in this market a realistic possibility for us? Are we just out of league, need to accept that, and either rent for the rest of our lives or move to a cheaper area (i.e. the suburbs)? Or, assuming we are absolutely unwilling to move to a cheaper market, do we need to keep saving until we have $400-$600k in order to afford houses in this area? Which I guess we could do. But I’d like to know where we stand.

Edit: I should add, we have no debt.

Thinking of rolling closing costs in and only paying lender fee and appraisal out of pocket (\~$1,000). I've been having some challenges with the math and if this is a good idea or not - seems like the savings might be around $20,000 or so if I take closing costs (initial and refi) out of the potential interest savings. Numbers are as follows:

* Initial Mortgage - $155,000 @ 4.125%
* Current balance - $126,400 with 18.5 years remaining
* Potential refi with closing costs rolled in - $131,000 @ 2.625%

t3_gj585p,Debt and Purchasing a First Home,"Hi All, longtime reader but have a few questions, and a few more given the interesting circumstances that we're currently living through. 

I've been planning to purchase my first house for a little while now and been working towards it. I'm tired of paying rent and certain I'm staying in my current city for the foreseeable future considering my partner and I have started a business here. The rub is, I've gone quite a bit into credit card debt (around $15k) over the past 2 years as we got the business established. I'm back to a good paying job within my field and he has secured sales growth and funding to ensure his paycheck (and stability for business). 

It's definitely possible for us to  continue to work for another 1-2 years and aggressively pay down the debt while still renting. However, I'd really like to make the jump sooner rather than later if possible. My state has a first time home buyer down payment assistance grant that several friends have used and highly recommend, so I'll likely use that even if I do have a down payment of my own. We are not married so I will be purchasing the house myself as per advice I've seen on here (and he filed bankruptcy for medical debt 4 years ago as well, so part of the reason). 

Prior to the credit card debt I had excellent credit and my score is still impeccable outside of the high (95%) utilization rate. I've looked at some calculators and gotten advice, but it seems that in order to quality for my state's mortgage/down payment program I'll need to raise my credit score by substantially dropping my CC balances. I just so happen to have about $15k in 2 retirement accounts from previous jobs, one of which I need to roll over into a new account or at least address in some way. 

My long winded question is, could I use these retirement funds to wipe out my remaining credit card debt, raise my score, and finally begin the process of purchasing a home? I know you're not supposed to touch these things, but it feels like a semi-good option to get into home ownership, which is its own form of retirement/wealth building.

t3_gj9lzs,Password Managers - Is putting all eggs in one basket a good idea?,"Lately a friend introduced me to password managers like Bitwarden and Lastpass (still deciding between those two).

It got me thinking about something: Is it a good idea to put every important password (like banking) in a password manager? If that master password is exposed, that would be bad news.

Currently, I have a unique (although generic pattern) password that I can remember for each site + 2FA. Most of the important banking sites also block new devices and require me to confirm through email (the master password).

I've read about creating a separate email for private use only, and making aliases for each banking site using that email. That email is never to be given out publicly.

t3_gj9jms,Now able to save a decent amount of money and would like advice how to balance cash vs. investment vs. retirement,"Hey all - here's some info about my sitaution:

I'm 27, single, and live in California. I got a hefty raise before this whole coronavirus thing - it was initially delayed, but is now effective as of May 1st.

My main long-term goal is to buy a house (still a long way off from that though). In the short-term, I will probably need to buy a new (used) car in the next 2-3 years as my current car is getting pretty old (2007). Mainly i just want to save and travel a little bit.

I also may be starting small side business which would require 2-3k in start up costs, but wouldn't really require much more cash beyond that.

Salary: $73,000

401k Contribution: 3% (no employer match, but they offer a safe harbor contribution of 3% of salary which i'm eligible for starting September)

IRA Contribution: I only contributed $200 last year, but would like some advice on 2020

Net Pay after tax, 401k, health insurance: $4,138/month (or) $49,656/year

My monthly expenses are roughly $2,000/month, but in an emergency situation, I could probably get it down to about $1,700 - maybe less if I absolutely had to

I owe about $1k on my car @ 6% interest, which should be paid off in the next 4/5 months. Other than that, I don't have any debt.

Currently my money is split:

1. Cash (checking/saving) - $12,100
2. Investment Account - $3,500
3. Retirement (401k/IRAs) - $8,100

Total = $23,700

What are your thoughts on that moving forward? I'm in a position to start saving a decent amount of money every month, but I want to be conscious of staying somewhat liquid to buy a car at some point and possibly start that side business. And even though it's a long way off, I also want to be able to buy a house at some point. I think you can only pull $10,000 from your IRA for that without getting penalized, which in California is basically nothing for the down payment.

t3_gj9icl,"Home Warranty for Homebuyer? Sudden Veterans Discount at Last Minute, But Must Be Used as Part of Transaction","Hey all, so I'm in contract to buy a house in Portland, OR on a 0% down VA loan. I do final walkthrough tonight, sign closing documents Friday, and record on Monday. I just got a call from my agent letting me know that the escrow company is offering a veteran's discount for about $375, but it has to be applied to the transaction. It's too late to modify the loan, and the seller is paying closing costs as part of the transaction, so I'm told that my only option at this point is to leave the money on the table or buy a home warranty. Normally I'd steer clear of home warranties, but since it's free money I figured I'd get a second opinion from Reddit.

My wife shopped around and found a couple of the apparently few reputable warranty providers out there, and currently we're considering the ""platinum"" plan from AFC Home Club, which costs $450/year (so we'd be about $75 out of pocket on the transaction), has a $125 service charge/copay, and let's you choose your own contractor to do work as long as they're licensed and bonded. They also ""guarantee"" their repairs as long as you retain coverage. Seems like a decent deal just in case anything comes out of left field in the first year. 

The home is overall in pretty good shape, with the only big imminent issue is the HVAC system that's 20-25 years old and using R22, so likely on its last legs and expensive to keep limping along. (Edit: Looking through their coverage it looks like repairs to and upgrading from an R22 system isn't covered) I've got a healthy emergency savings and a stable job amidst all of the economic turmoil (or else I wouldn't even be buying this house), so if the HVAC or anything else goes I could feel comfortable dealing with it. I'm leaning toward going for it, but I also recognize that warranties are almost always a waste of money so I want to make sure I don't have stars in my eyes.

My parents bought a timeshare from Westgate about 20 years ago. Apparently up until a year or two ago they have been paying on it. My father passed away a while back and my mother has come to a point where my sister and I have had to move home to help take care of her and the house. We have gotten calls from Westgate (supposedly) for about a year now but they will not talk to me, only my father or mother. I explain that my father passed and that my mother doesn't communicate well but they still won't tell me anything. We recently got a phone that blocks spam calls so we haven't had calls from them for a while. Well this letter showed up and now I realize why they were calling.

In late December I became desperate to try to find a way to get out of cc debt. I was making just enough to float my bills and one cc i let become delinquent because medical things came up.

I started searching online for solutions some sort of relief and I found ClearOne Advantage a debt ""relief"" program. They promised the moon and paying only 50% of what i owe on average and will be out of debt twice as fast. 

Naturally i did some research but was under too much pressure to REALLY dive deep, I signed up. I'm now five months in they have three of my creditors agreed to structured settlements. 

I just feel lost and I also feel like doing this i'm completely fucked in credit for the next seven years. 

Is there something else i can do? At this point i'm now 5 months late on my other creditors that haven't gone to settlement and owe for lack of an exact number greater than 10k but less 15k. 

Should i back out of the program? What should i do?

t3_gj80xh,401k to ROTH IRA Rollover - Laid off edition,"Hi Finance Gurus on Reddit!

I need your advice. I was recently laid off from my employer in late FEB 2020 from ole 'Rona, and I will not return to the same employer. When the market was in a down spiral, I also moved 100% of my 401k mutual fund investments to Money Market account to not lose more % of my total portfolio (I know...I know...rookie mistake, but whats done is now done....Lesson learned) and my overall portfolio went from $150k to $100k :(

I am 29 and believe to rollover my company sponsored 401k to a ROTH IRA would be in my best interest. I figure with 40ish years left until retirement, a ROTH conversion now makes the most sense - i bite the bullet and pay taxes now on $100k, and be able to withdraw the rewards of compound interest 40 years from now tax free in its totality.

Here is my logic and please let me know where this doesnt make sense:

1. I understand that I will owe Federal and State Income Taxes on that $100k - but if there is a brightside to my story, I now dont have to pay taxes on $150k hahaha
2. I forsee the majority of this year job hunting and free-lancing work so WITHOUT the $100k I expect to be in the lowest tax bracket for 2020 single filers - 10% (less than $9,875 annual income)
3. I know that I can split the rollover into X% per year to allow me to stay in a lower tax bracket. So for example, 2020's 12% Tax bracket is $9,876 to $40,125. So if I rolled over, say 33%, I would only owe 12% of $33k rather than 24% of $100k. In this example, I am taking three years to roll it all over, paying $12,030 total in federal taxes over 3 years  vs $19,200 for taxes owed this year.
4. Using the previous example, I understand that would I lose the magic compound interest if I break up the rollover into 3 years. If I go ahead and transfer the full $100k, by the end of that third year, I believe that $100k would be larger than rolling over $33k for three years, and be large enough to offset the tax differential.
5. Plus THIS year, I know what my federal tax bracket will be (10%) and I can plan accordingly. The next three years I will not know what my tax bracket will be.
6. I thought about rolling over $30k in Dec 2020 and then the other $70k in Jan 2021. That way, they hit different tax years AND I wont lose the compound interest opportunity because I will be with the full $100k within weeks of each other. 
7. As I mentioned, i am 100% in money market accounts. If I invest back into mutual funds and wait until Dec to rollover, my account will be (hopefully) larger, and I will owe more taxes than rolling over today.

So should I rollover now? Other plans/strategies I havent considered?

t3_gj7v5r,I need some help regarding my job furlough/lay-off and some finicky text on the unemployment benefits page.,"**Disclaimer: I'm aware that PUA exists and I will use it before attempting to look for a new job, but for the sake of simplicity, let's pretend it doesn't exist for the issue I'm presenting below. Thank you.**

For context, I live in Oregon and (for obvious reasons) everyone in the restaurant I work for got a temporary leave. This was back in the middle of March. I filed a claim a week later and have received four weekly benefit payments since (with the extra $600 included). However, this brings my to my problem and question: 

It seems that maybe I've reached my limit on weekly unemployment benefits for furlough/lay-off? I've always clicked the checkmark next to this text (highlighted the important part in bold):

&gt; ""I am temporarily unemployed because I have been laid off or had my hours reduced and expect to return to work with my employer. I am returning to work that is full-time or work that pays more than my weekly benefit amount. **There are no more than four (4) weeks between the week I became temporarily unemployed and the week I am returning to work.** I have stayed in contact with my employer. I understand false answers may result in overpaid benefits and additional penalties I must pay back.""

So does this mean I have to actively look for a new job in order to continue to receive benefits? I thought so, but then I read this text on the same page:

&gt; ""You are actively seeking work if you will return to your employer or are willing to look for work when state and local emergency declarations related to the coronavirus expire or otherwise are no longer in effect.""

t3_gj7s9t,Car loan and home improvement question,"Hello. We need about 60,000 in home improvement repairs. The house is paid for but worth so little we can't get a home improvement loan. After mandatory retirement plan , insurance for family and Roth 401k plus household bills we have 850 leftover. 

Car loan is 355 a month at 5.99. 18,000 left. Our credit score has improved to 730 range according to credit card company information they provide on app. It was a 72 month loan. Been paying a year.  Should we try to refinance this loan? 

We pay for homeowners insurance. Thats included in my budget above. 

We have 7700 in savings. Should I put that toward car loan? 

How would you move forward? The home improvement can wait but it would help on energy costs. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.  I can provide more information also.

Thanks reddit!

t3_gj0ry1,Moving states and confused on how to calculate tax benefit of one state over the other,"I live in Boston and pay about $183 per pay period in state income tax. I am going to work remote and move to either Texas or South Carolina.

This year (2020) is weird and has 27 pay periods so I will pay 27\*\~183 = \~4941 dollars in state taxes this yea if I stayed in Mass all year.

So that cheaper Charleston rent by 300 bucks or so doesn't seem so hot now!

So, in both instances, I mailed the IRS my form 8962 and everything else they desired in the month of March. As for last year's refund, I was not seeing the status of my return being updated nor was I receiving my money, so I called the IRS. I'm not sure what they did, but I'm pretty sure all there was was a hold on my account and the dude did something on his end and I received my money shortly after.

t3_gj7l9f,Should I sale my car or store it ?,"Hello,

I am looking for financial advise about whether or not I should sell my car.

I am 23 years old and will be moving soon. My salary will be 65k and a little over 48k after tax. I am currently 14k in debt. 7k are student loans and 7k are student loans I used for my car.

I have a 2015 Honda Civic LX about 75k miles. I purchased it in 2017 for about 11k. I’m moving to a city where I won’t really need my car and the apartment garage fees are expensive ($185 a month). I’m quite sure I’m going to leave it at my family’s house in the garage while I work for 2-3 years. 

My question is: should I sell my car or keep it?

If I keep my car, I will be paying about $600 a month for 24 months to get rid of my debt. I won’t be struggling and I will still have money for rent, spending, saving, etc. 

However, if I sale my car, for 7k-9k I could apply that directly to my debt and cut my debt in half. I could then greatly increase my savings ratio and pay the rest of my debt quicker and thus owe less on interest. My concern however is that if I decide to go to graduate school (currently that is the plan) and move then I will likely need a car. And then I’ll end up still needing to take from my savings to purchase a car (I would likely get a used Honda Civic again but a later model and stay in the 10-12k budget).

Currently my budget is:

~$4000 after tax

$1500 toward rent and utilities
$1000 in spending
$500 savings 
$600 in debt
$400 (this May go to savings or may go to health- considering getting braces again, etc.)

However if I sold my car I would lower my debt and increase savings substantially but con is I may have to repurchase car anyways in 2-3 years.

Thank you.

t3_gj784f,MBNA.ca Credit Card Fraud?,"I'm looking for advice/help, (for reference i live in canada/toronto).

I have an online credit card with a bank (mbna.ca) , some back story, I have had this card for 6 years and have never made a single purchase on it because I exclusively use it to hold debt at times due to their low interest rate.

About a little over a month ago I received a phone call from [infoprotector.ca](https://www.infoprotector.ca/), this company claim to be calling **on behalf of MBNA** and were offering a credit protection plan of some sort which I quickly denied. A few weeks later they sent me a physical mail pamphlet which i just threw out cause I was by no means interest in their service.

Surprise surprise 2 weeks later I got charged ($100) for this service that I never authorized, wanted nor gave my credit card info to. In fact like i said above I have never made any purchase with this credit card so the only explanation is that they somehow got the info from my bank, which makes sense since they literally said they were calling on behalf of MBNA.

I tried to contact MBNA about it and they quickly turn me down and asked me to contact infoprotect first. Turns out their phone number cant be called due to covid19 so I had to send them an email which two weeks later is still unanswered.

I went back to my bank to try and report their fraud but they once again said there is nothing they can do about it cause is a third party. After a lot of back and forth and getting transfer through every department, they ended up transferring me to the dispute department which I waited for one hour and they never pick up despite every other department picking up within 1 minute.

Is becoming quite clear to me that they aren't gonna help me and are defiantly in on the fraud, so I'm just wondering what are the best next steps for me take? also wondering if anyone else with this bank has had similar issues?

t3_gj74m9,"Is a Roth IRA really worth it? Penalties, complex regulations, etc.","I know I'm going to get downvotes for this since I'm going against the grain, I'm ready for them.

I am self employed. Personal finance wisdom seems to suggest that I use Roth IRA (USA) to save for retirement. I have done my research on Roth IRA's and I do not like what I have found so far.

- Subject to 10% early withdrawal penalty. I am young and I plan to FIRE. I do not want this money tied up for another 30 years. Maybe I FIRE, maybe I want to take a sabbatical, maybe I want to pay rent with investments for awhile, etc.
- Early withdrawal regulations for Roth IRA's are complex. I'll read articles that say things like ""Roth IRA withdrawals are penalty free"" and ""Roth IRA's incur a 10% withdrawal penalty"" and these contradictory phrases will be side by side in the same article.
- All this work to waive a 15% capital gains tax. Income tax is already paid. Doesn't seem like much benefit just to waive 15% capital gains tax.
- My brokerage bank, Ally, doesn't appear to have Roth IRA brokerage accounts. [Only CD and savings.](https://www.ally.com/bank/ira/ira-account/). So I would have to split into 2 brokerage accounts at different banks, which increases complexity. And the second bank would probably charge fees (Ally doesn't charge account fees or trade commissions for the type of trading I do)
- There are major limits on how much can be contributed per year. $6000 seems very low. I like having a minimum number of bank accounts (one checking, one brokerage) and just glancing at one dashboard. I don't really want to make multiple bank accounts at multiple banks just for $6000/yr.

It sounds like there's 3 scenarios that I can be put in:

- Roth IRA, no early withdrawal - I don't withdrawal my money for 30 years and I get 0% capital gains tax
- Roth IRA, early withdrawal - I withdrawal my money early and have to pay 15% capital gains tax + 10% withdrawal penalty = 25%.
- Taxable Account- I keep my single brokerage account (simplicity), and my freedom to withdrawal whenever I want, and just pay a flat 15% no matter when I withdraw.

t3_gj2qfd,Should I pay off my PMI or get a new roof?,"I'm 32 and am one of the fortunate ones that was able to keep my job (local government) during the shutdown. We had a honeymoon in Italy booked for this month but that got cancelled, obviously. That, along with not going out or spending as much due to places being closed, we have been able to save quite a bit. We currently have $14,000 in savings. The only debt we have is our house and we owe around $107,000 on it still. It will take close $8000 to eliminate the PMI.

However, our house is due for a new roof. It's at least 15 years old and has a few leaks. I've patched them for now but another one always pops up. This is probably the last year it will make it. 

Since we didn't get our honeymoon, the wife still wants to go somewhere big when things get better. That will more than likely cost close to $7000 but won't be until next year.

Both of our cars run but are older. It could be time to finally buy something newer (not brand new) and more reliable but that's probably our least concern.

I don't plan on making a move until I get about $20,000 saved.

t3_gj71r6,Does transferring money from a taxable brokerage to Roth IRA incur taxes?,"I like the idea of maxing out my Roth IRA at the beginning of every year to give as much time as possible for it to accumulate gains (I do 100% VTWAX). However, this requires having $6k ready to go on January 1st, which for me requires saving up that $6k throughout the previous year. I thought it might be nice to stick the $6k in a regular taxable brokerage until moving it to the Roth on January 1st of the next year, to (effectively) give the money even more time to build up (instead of just letting it sit as cash).

So I e-filed my 2019 taxes on January 29th of this year through TT, just as I have the past few years. It's a joint file with my wife and my toddler claimed. Last year, it went through no issues and we got our state and fed within a few weeks (we got the EIC so fed took a bit longer, which we knew). However, this year, we only received our state rather quickly. We also received a letter from the IRS on February 20th stating our federal return was randomly selected for an accuracy review but we didn't have to do anything on our end. Nothing changed in our filing compared to last year (TT had all our information already). It said it would take up to 60 days then the refund would be issued, on top of the extended wait due to getting the EIC. 

Here it is May 13th, and the Where's My Refund? tool STILL shows ""still processing, a refund date will be provided when available"" with no progress bar. We haven't received anything else from the IRS, and we can't call due to no live staffing.

t3_gj6shs,I’m about to get 10k in payroll advances from work... how do I prepare for this?,"Posting from a throwaway. I work for a salon as a cosmetologist. The owner of the salon (and my boss) recently applied and was approved for a small business PPP loan. He notified me and my coworkers today that we would be receiving ~10k in payroll advances, paid out from that loan (the amount is based on how much we earned individually last year, but this was the average amount).

My boss told us all that this money hasn’t been taxed, so we need to save accordingly... About how much should I plan to put away in preparation for taxes? Is the 30% benchmark a good place to start?

Also, what happens if I decide to resign while I still “owe” the salon (e.g., I’ve only worked the equivalent of 5k in wages)? How would that affect money I owe in taxes/etc.? Are there any pieces of documentation I should be sure to get? 

My plan right now is to deposit the sum into my savings, and then withdraw my usual paycheck amount on the dates when I would have been paid.

Sorry if these are stupid questions with obvious answers. There’s so much conflicting information out there on how these PPP loans work— I started to feel really overwhelmed after just a few minutes of research.

t3_gj6mi0,What private student loans should I consider for getting a B.A in Pure Mathematics?,"Hey Reddit,

I consider taking out a private student loan. I know it should be the last resort but I do not know what else I can do. Right now I need to make a choice: either accept the fact that every resume of mine or any application form I have to fill out will always contain ""Education: High School Diploma"" or take out $50,000 in loans to pay the tuition fees and housing. Honestly, I do not know which of the two is worse. I have done all I can to avoid taking out a private loan. I have completed two years at a community college, knocking out all of the utterly useless general education requirements, and have transferred to a local university (not a top university, but quite decent). I'm a math major and intend to go to graduate school for a statistics degree. Now, the university I transferred to, has not offered me anything but federal loans. The federal loans cover only half of the tuition each semester. On top of that, I will be living in a $400-$500 apartment close to campus. Also, I will not be working during the first semester at the new school, since I intend to take a quite heavy course load so that I can graduate in two years and have a good chance at being accepted to a Ph.D. program. I understand that taking private loans should be the last resort, but I have exhausted all options. I have also considered taking Parent Plus loans, but since I will be 24 years old next semester, I will not be eligible for that. Thus, private loans.

Currently, as an in-state resident, I will need to pay $8,500 in tuition fees per semester. I also estimate that I would need about $6000 per year to pay rent plus food. Thus, two semesters at university would cost me $23,000. I need to complete four semesters, hence $46,000 for a B.A in Pure Mathematics. I intend to go to grad school right after undergrad and would like to defer payments until after I finish the graduate program. On the bright side, I will be 24 next year and will be considered an independent student, so I hope the university will take that into consideration and offer me some financial aid.

Now, the reason I'm typing all this: I need your advice on what private student loan lenders I should consider? In particular, I need to pick one that would allow me to DEFER payments until I finish graduate school. I have talked with Sallie Mae about Smart Option Student Loan, and they said that I would be able to defer payments until after I finish grad school. But I'm not sure I believe that. They told me that I would need to call an agent after completing undergrad so that they would defer payments. Could anyone confirm that it's true? If no, what other private loan providers should I consider?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I should clarify a few things. I was awarded $3500 in Stafford loans per semester. That means I would need to find an additional $5000 to pay off the rest of the tuition, and hence I'm considering taking out a private loan. In total,  I would need to borrow $14,000 in Stafford loans and about $32,000 in private loans to pay for the entire undergrad degree. Secondly, I should have mentioned something about the career I'm pursuing -- machine learning (basically applied statistics). It's quite difficult to get a job in the industry straight out of undergrad unless you go to a top school, so most ML positions require a graduate degree. What I'm worried about is that  I won't be allowed to defer payments and would need to start paying off the undergrad debt while in grad school.

t3_gj6g1x,Should I sell my car to buy a newer but cheaper one?,"A few years ago I made an impulsive decision and bought a 2007 Boxster while I was 19 and still living at home. I bought it for $18kish and ended up putting around $10k worth of repairs into it over the course of the last few years (IMS bearing is a killer). It's all paid off and I am no longer living at home. After those repairs I said to myself I would run it into the ground to make it worth the money I threw at it.

While I still absolutely love the car, it doesn't have quite the same ""wow"" factor it once had. It has 69,000 miles on it so the plan would be to hopefully sell it for around $13k and buy a newer cheaper car for $8k leaving me with an extra $5kish to put towards a down payment on my first house (which I don't plan on looking for one for another year and a half. It also wouldn't make or break the down payment.)

The financially responsible thing to me would be to sell it, but I still really enjoy driving it and every other car I touch just seems off. Idk if that's simply because I'm not used to them. I'm afraid the minute I sell it I would regret it.

So the question is, is the $5k (and cheaper gas and maintenance) worth it? Or should I keep my ""live while I'm young"" attitude and enjoy it while I can?

I called to express my displeasure, but I'm curious. Are people ok with this? Am I in the minority for being pissed that such a basic thing as bank bill pay is being removed as an option?

My reasoning for not attaching my bank info to Vanguard is firstly that I don't let people pull from my bank. I only push money out. And secondly it's stupid for me to give 10 institutions my info for them to pull instead of one institution instructions to push. I can't imagine what a pain it the ass it would be to change banks and have to go to everyone that I pay and switch the account information. Why would I consider that when I can just use bill pay to organize everything in one place?

As for the app, I guess that's a somewhat reasonable option other than the fact that I only keep about ten checks for my bank account. I mean, who uses paper checks anymore? Not me, because *I use bill pay* for everything that can't be done with my credit card. If need be, I guess I will go with this option and probably only send money in once a quarter or so.

Vanguard says that they're trying to increase processing times and decrease situations where they aren't sure how the money should be treated. But...that just doesn't fly for me. I've never once had them come back to me to ask me what the check they received is meant for. And if they did, they have a contact portal through which they can easily address the question. I have never once complained about the processing time for my check. If I did, they would be more than welcome to offer the above solutions as faster options for me.

I'm just astonished that Vanguard would decide that bank bill pay is no longer an option for depositing money, and wondering if I'm an outlier in thinking that this is not an acceptable decision for a company who keeps so much of my money to make. I'm interested in hearing what others thoughts are on this. Maybe I'm just being picky and old fashioned to stick with a system that has worked for many, many years?",personalfinance,vanguard longer allowing check sent bill pay bank,got email vanguard received bill pay check bank depositing money ira email say starting july longer accepting deposit manner suggest add bank account number site pull money upload paper check app deposit called express displeasure curious people minority pissed basic thing bank bill pay removed option reasoning attaching bank info vanguard firstly let people pull bank push money secondly stupid give institution info pull instead one institution instruction push imagine pain would change bank everyone pay switch account information would consider use bill pay organize everything one place app guess somewhat reasonable option fact keep ten check bank account mean paper check anymore use bill pay everything done credit card need guess option probably send money quarter vanguard say trying increase processing time decrease situation sure money treated fly never come back ask check received meant contact portal easily address question never complained processing time check would welcome offer solution faster option astonished vanguard would decide bank bill pay longer option depositing money wondering outlier thinking acceptable decision company keep much money make interested hearing others thought maybe picky old fashioned stick system worked many many year,vanguard longer allowing check sent bill pay bank got email vanguard received bill pay check bank depositing money ira email say starting july longer accepting deposit manner suggest add bank account number site pull money upload paper check app deposit called express displeasure curious people minority pissed basic thing bank bill pay removed option reasoning attaching bank info vanguard firstly let people pull bank push money secondly stupid give institution info pull instead one institution instruction push imagine pain would change bank everyone pay switch account information would consider use bill pay organize everything one place app guess somewhat reasonable option fact keep ten check bank account mean paper check anymore use bill pay everything done credit card need guess option probably send money quarter vanguard say trying increase processing time decrease situation sure money treated fly never come back ask check received meant contact portal easily address question never complained processing time check would welcome offer solution faster option astonished vanguard would decide bank bill pay longer option depositing money wondering outlier thinking acceptable decision company keep much money make interested hearing others thought maybe picky old fashioned stick system worked many many year

t3_giyumf,Wanting Mortgage Advice Regarding Financial Situation,"First off, my financial situation, I don't think I should be buying a home today. However, I am planning to hopefully consider my option later this year (earliest September) or early next year. I will be in grad school for my Master of Science in Computer Science for another two years, as well as well probably remain here for awhile, which is also where my family is located, so I plan on staying here for awhile. My credit card debt is where it is due to primarily vet bills, but also as due to splitting with an ex and being forced to pay almost 50% of my monthly income on rent. Though, I should be able to pay it down quickly soon.

Secondary Income (eBay sales): \~$10K/year

Savings: $5K

Insurance: $100/month

Food: \~$400/month

**Other Information:**

Starting a new job the first of next month, which if all goes as planned, will give me a major increase in my income. Additionally, my new partner is moving in with me and will be taking almost half of the rent obligation which will help a lot. Overall, with the new job and having a lower rent obligation, I am estimating it will put another $2300/month in my pocket. Also, once I pay off the personal and car loan, it will raise that to almost $3000/month I will have available to put aside for a new house.

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions:**

* Is it unreasonable of me to consider getting a house before paying off all of my existing debt, excluding student loans? The range I would be looking for is $200K-$300K in USDA eligible areas.
* If I were to pay off debt, for the sake of bringing up my credit score and putting my DTI where it needs to be, what should I prioritize?

t3_giq80f,"Just got a bill from a hospitalization from 2018, but I paid up to my out of pocket max in 2018, so how did I get this bill? Help!","I was hospitalized for a week in September of 2018. Over the coming months after getting out of the hospital, I received numerous bills/letters/etc from my insurance company/the hospital and I paid everything immediately. Considering the cost of healthcare in the US,  these amounts were way higher than my out of pocket maximum pocket maximum, so I ended up paying that much (I believe it was $3500) and all my deductibles, etc. I had some more procedures in November and December, and they were all covered 100% because I had hit that out of pocket maximum.

Fast forward 20 months and I just received a bill for $303.20 from the hospital for my hospitalization in 2018. The bill isn't like any other bill I've gotten from them, because the “adjustments”, “patient payments”, and “amount due” columns are all blank all the way down the bill, and then the last line item is “adjustments and payments” which reads:
Adjustments: -$4362.80
Patient payments: -$200.00
Charges: - $4866.00
Amount due: $303.20

I called the hospital and they said that this bill was generated because my insurance company (blue cross blue shield) had just reprocessed the bill on 05/02/20 and adjusted what they were paying, so I was responsible for the difference that that's why I got the bill.

I already paid my out of pocket maximum in 2018, so how can I be billed more for services that occurred in 2018? If the insurance company is denying to pay the full amount for specific line items, why are the line items “adjustments”, “patient payments”, and “amount due” all blank? I've read online that it isn't uncommon for someone to get a bill a year or so later than a hospitalization, but this is almost two years, which I find completely absurd. I know that debts can still be collected for years (5 years?) but from what I understand this isn't an old debt I owe, it's a new debt due to the hospital or insurance company changing what was paid, which just seems so fishy to me. Like as if I sold you a car 20 months ago and now today I'm changing the price, if that makes sense.

Do I have any recourse in fighting this, or am I just stuck paying out? I've been furloughed at work with no timeline for coming back, so every penny counts right now. I already tried to talk to the hospital about it, and they only help their financial department offered was to set me up with a 12 month payment plan. 

Any advice for how to deal with this would be greatly appreciated!


UPDATE:

Unfortunately I don't have much to update, and I really haven't gotten anywhere with this after 6 hours on the phone with them. I contacted the hospital and they said this bill was generated because Blue Cross denied or updated a claim. I called Blue Cross and they said that wasn't true and they had no idea what the hospital was talking about, and that they have this claim marked as paid and closed on February of 2019. After calling each of them half a dozen times, each one saying the other is either lying or doesn't know what they're talking about, I called them both on a conference call and sat on mute for over two hours while they discussed the bill. None of it made much sense to me and they didn't even seem to know how to talk to each other - The hospital would say ""here is the claim number XXXXXXXX"" and the insurance would say ""That's not a claim number, we don't use letters in our claim numbers, what are you talking about"" and on and on. At this point they have now sent me an itemized bill, but it doesn't have specific line items adding up to the total they claim I owe. They are saying that these charges technically occurred before the date that I hit my OOP maximum, and I argued that if that was the case, shouldn't I be refunded for any payments I made after that date, because as it stands now this payment will put my out of pocket over the maximum. That didn't get me anywhere and they said I should call my bank for all statements from 2018 to verify whether I truly paid my OOP maximum or whether I still owe $303.20 in order to hit that maximum. Blue Cross is physically mailing me an updated EOB and itemized list that they say will clarify all of this, but I don't think it will. I was also told that because this bill is from 20 months ago it is too late to file an appeal or dispute the charges, but I think that's just a lie to keep me from trying to pursue that option. All in all, I'm out 6 hours of phone calls today alone, and I feel like I'm still on the hook for this complete BS bill.

t3_gj5fs8,How do I handle my parents lying about car insurance?,"So...I want to get a cheap used car soon, but I found out that my parents have a weird insurance scheme.

My father wants me to change the address on my license and put the car title in my mother's name (my dad doesn't work, so everything is in her name), because then they'll just add me as a named driver and will get cheaper insurance that way.

I won't be putting her name on the title because I'm the one paying for the car. I'm also pretty sure that I'm required to be on the insurance anyway, because I live at the same residence.

My father is actually pretending to not be married to my mother, and has a different address on his license. I heard her and him on the phone with the insurance company, and my mother clearly said she was single. My parents have been married since before I was born.

So. My parents are refusing to budge. I don't want to commit fraud by pretending we're not related or like I live somewhere else. I also really will not ever put their names on my car title because I don't want to deal with their scams. They actually got audited by the IRS awhile ago...and I'm suspicious they just want the title in their names to steal it from me.

What can I do? The issue is that I think my father may have excluded me from the car insurance without telling me, like filling out the exclusion form and sending it to the insurance company. I got my license last year and from what I've read, I should have been automatically added to the policy by the company whether my parents wanted it or not. My father handles all the finances and will do anything to save money.

But I don't know what really happened or what to do or anything really...

**As a sidenote:** My parents for some reason keep pretending to want to buy me a car and then pull out at the last minute. The most recent incident was my father saying he'll make my mother give me $5,000 after they sell their house, so I can pay for college or a car. He wants to pay half and I pay the other half. But my parents have never helped me out financially and especially not with big purchases. I mentioned buying a car with 100% my money, and neither of them seemed to care.

I've spent most of my life bouncing between good and bad credit.  I'm finally in a place where my debt is manageable and decreasing, and my credit report is free from derogatory accounts and information.

Because I spent half my life with poor credit, I am a huge advocate of teaching kids to manage their credit and finances as early as possible.  I spout off about it as often as possible, and I was pretty sure that no one listened.  Evidently my niece was actually paying attention!  Her mother is on the streets so she lives with one of my other sisters.  She asked if we could teach her about finances and good credit, something she knows nothing about.  I'm soooo excited to get her started!

That brings me to my question, what are the things that we should be educating our teens about to prepare them for their financial future?  I am thinking how to read a check stub, how taxes work, getting and maintaining a bank account (the minor bank account thread is what finally pushed me to ask this question), interest rates/credit cards/good vs. bad debt.  Of course that's just a high level idea of topics, what else do you think would be a good addition to helping her be financial knowledgeable?  Are there any tools or sites you would recommend?

t3_gj0fu4,Potential Debt Collection Scam?,"I recently started receiving a call from a ""CMI Group"" that is apparently some sort of debt collector.  They have called multiple times, each time refusing to provide me any information unless I provide them the last four of my social or my address (which I won't give them). When I push for information about the supposed debt, they just end up stating that I will receive something in the mail and then hang up. It's been over a week since they started calling and I have no received anything in the mail.

This organization looks to be based in Texas but are calling from an area code (multiple different numbers as I started to block them) associated with an area I haven't lived in for +10 years (I am in a completely different state now), although I have retained my phone number with that old area code.

I pulled all three of my credit reports and there is nothing on any of them about collections, or anything adverse for that matter. None of my accounts have ever been late and I have never carried any sort of loan/credit card debt outside of my car loan which was paid off early.  I do see though that ""**CREDIT MANAGEMENT LP""** made a soft inquiry prior to the calls starting.

I have been racking my brain trying to determine what debt I may have but I cant think of anything.  If there is a legitimate debt, I completely onboard for settling it......this just has a sketchy feeling so far.

Is there anything I can do to figure out what debt I may have without providing them personal details? I also wasn't sure if this was a scam, or possibly a legit debt associated with mistaken/stoled identify.

I’m currently putting money away into a savings account for 3 things:

-my “adventure fund” for trips/fun stuff
-my general savings/emergency money

Im currently putting everything into the same account because it’s a very high interest account.

Is there a drawback if I separate this money into 3 different accounts? I’m hoping to get the house in the next 2-3 years so that account would only be temporary, other two would be basically permanent unless I switch banks. I just find it strange that they only gave me one account when I implied I wanted 3, so If only having one account gives me an advantage I’m unaware of then it would be nice to know of it.

t3_gj441i,County lost my property tax payment--Should I now overpay or underpay property taxes (CA)?,"I bought my home in 2019, and received an $8000 tax bill 3/2020 (county took forever to re-assess property).  Also in 3/2020 I refinanced my mortgage and the title company sent the county a $7000 check to cover any property tax due.  So by my calculations I need to pay $1000, due by 5/31.

However, the county's online tax portal says I still owe $8000.  The title company has sent me a copy of the cleared check which shows the County has received and deposited the funds, and the correct parcel number is clearly listed on the check.  

After multiple calls (with &gt;1 hour hold times), each time they say they have *not* received the check and transfer me to different offices/people who do not pick up.  I have emailed and faxed them the copy of the cleared check too. I cannot go to the their offices (closed due to COVID), and there seems to be nobody at the County who can give me a straight answer.

**Question**:  I have a feeling it's going to take a while for them to ""find"" the $7000 they already deposited.  But since the $8000 is due before May 31, do I:

* A) Pay the county only the balance I think is due ($1000)?  I am sure if I only give them $1000 they will charge me penalties (and maybe place a lien on my house?) which will take multiple phone calls to reverse once they find the $7000.

* B) Pay the entire tax bill ($8000)  and then try to appeal for a refund later?  At least this way I won't get penalties/lien assessed, but I have a feeling it will be an uphill battle to recover my $7000 overpayment.

Current thought is to pay $8,300 (all cash on hand) towards my $11,000 personal credit card which will bring me down under 30% utilization having somewhat of a decent impact onto credit score. Along with this, I plan to get added onto my father's credit card and piggyback off of his 800+ credit score. I've heard this is a great thing to do, obviously only if that person is reliable. 

Wait a couple of months to have that impact hit my credit score then attempt to apply for a 0% balance transfer for 18 months credit card. If approved, hopefully for a decent amount, I will then transfer my business card debt to the new card paying monthly without getting interest charges. If that all works out I can attack this debt over the 18 months and have it paid off. 

The only concern so far is student loan debt. I have not made any payments towards it and hopefully will have bigger cashflow by September to make big impact payments.

I'm about to open up a 529 college savings account for my son who just turned 4. We live in Massachusetts, and I've been told we have a good 529 program through Fidelity.

When I was mentioning it yesterday, someone warned me against setting up the account in my son's name, because it can result in colleges mishandling the funds when they process payment. It was vague to me, but something also clicked in my memory that I mightve read a similar warning a few years back in an article or something.

So is there any truth to what he was saying? Is there a right/wrong way to open a 529 in MA?

t3_gj3gl9,"Questions on Roth IRA, High Yield Savings Account, Unemployment Funds - Beginner","Hi everyone,

This subreddit is AMAZING. Thanks to whoever created this, and thanks to everyone who contributes. 

So I've been doing reading through some posts, and I want to make sure I make sense...

I'm 28 (I know...pretty late), and I finished graduate school at the end of summer 2019. I'm not working at all right now, and I'm living at home. The job search hasn't been that great to me, unfortunately. I left my part-time job in January to focus more on the job search...then the pandemic hit. -\_-

My expenses at the moment are very minimal: Car and car insurance expenses, groceries, and store credit cards. I deferred my graduate student loans another year based on the income I made at my previous job. I don't have a 401K because either I've worked part-time jobs or IC jobs. 

I got approved for UI, and I should be getting my card in the mail by the end of the week. I chose to withhold taxes on my UI funds.

This is the plan I have for the next two months (hopefully this is correct): 

1. Pay off store credit cards - $2000 worth
2. Create an emergency fund through a high yield savings account. Planning to put the settlement I received from a car accident into this account. Seems like Capital One, Ally, and Discover are the big contenders from what I'm reading.
3. Open a Roth IRA. Seems like Fidelity, Schwab, and Vanguard are the most popular ones. Sidenote, I honestly don't think I'll be getting married for another 5 years.
4. Start life insurance back up again. I was planning on doing this when I get my FT role.

Would love feedback on my plan, but I do have questions:

1. How did you decide on which bank/brokerage was for you? 
2. For the Roth IRA, I can definitely contribute to 2019 at the max with part of the settlement, but I already filed my taxes back in February. My income for 2019 was less than $20K. Did I qualify for the Saver's Credit? If so, do I need to file an amendment?
3. When I do open the Roth IRA, should I go for a target date fund? Or...?
4. Lastly, I have Series EE savings bonds that I received between the ages of 0-13. Two of them will be at maturity in 18 months, the others are halfway matured. I've checked the values of all of them already. Should I wait until all of the bonds are matured? I don't really have a need for using them at the moment, other than saving up for my own place in the future.

t3_gj3177,At a loss of how to help my parents who were evicted in Jan and now live with me.,"Hi everyone. I feel like I should have written this months ago, but I need help and was hoping for some advice from people smarter than me. I am 26 and in January I found out that my parents were evicted from their home. We had only four days (from when they told me--they kept me in the dark for the month that they knew) to put everything away into a storage unit and they now live with me and my fiance. It was a blur, to say the least.

My parents both only have high school diplomas. My dad is the kind of person who buys those get rich quick books and is an ""entrepreneur."" My mom didn't have a job for 15 years until the recession in 2008. Since then, she worked odd jobs as a brand ambassador for marketing companies.

They came to me with tons of debt and now are having trouble finding jobs. COVID obviously has not helped; my dad found a job where he was making a decent bit of money but lost that due to the pandemic. My mom has been driving for Uber Eats and my fiance recently made me aware of how that'll hurt her when tax season rolls around next year. She is living with my sister three hours away because my fiance's job was very strict about minimizing risk of spreading COVID since he is still going into the office.

They have two cars with loans out on both. Thousands of dollars of debt. With just the cars, car insurance, phone bills, storage rental, and whatever essential bills they have to pay, they have around 800 in monthly expenses.

I don't know if that's sufficient information. I'll happily add more. All of this came less than a month after my engagement and obviously it has been really hard to come down from something so exciting to...this. I'm a teacher and my fiance is an accountant. We make okay money and save a good bit but live in a high cost of living area. We were looking to buy a house but I don't know what's even financially feasible anymore. I would appreciate any ideas you all have for me.

- I want to immediately go in with £1000 but then monthly add to this with a couple hundred, is this advisable or is it better to save and stick with bigger lump sums?

- I was looking at opening a shares account through my bank but are there any other places I should look first?

- Also what sort of estimated return % would you guess based on past experience, I know this isn't gospel and nothing is guaranteed.

t3_gj2q7j,"House Hack vs. ""Condo Hack""","I'm very aware that the smartest way to go about owning a home would be to do the traditional house hack of putting the DP in, and then having an outside person pay rent to cover the mortgage.

I'm not able to be financed with a loan, but I was wondering if a condo would work the same way? I am saving up to have enough for a small condo (Around $50k) that I could pay in straight-up cash. I am almost never home, and I have a roommate likes that a lot, and who wants to move around the same time as I do, so I am going to have her pay 1/2 of the rent of the other condos, as another stream of income.

I'm a bit worried about things like HOA fees, or other fees that I am not aware about that comes with the condo ownership.

&amp;#x200B;

Small breakdown of what I have so far:

Water, Trash and Gas is paid for by the HOA, which is $300 a month. (Is this a good price? it seems like it to me)

Electric bill we would split.

HOA fee would normally be the landlord's expense (I think), so I would pay this.

Taxes are defindelty the landlord's expense, which according to the 2019 past owner's tax bill receipt is around $1,000 a year.

I have a modest car, old furniture, no subscriptions, no designer clothes, cheaper apartment etc. My best friend buys me clothes more than I buy for myself. Even to replace my phone I had to think for months. The only money I can freely spent is on dinners and traveling. If I go dinners often, I feel guilty. 

Any financial cost can make me easily upset; for example, cable company was charging me more than new customer, I have changed the company and the new bill came with bunch of hidden costs. I need to shop for renewal of insurance but I keep procrastinating. I feel any finance decisions are taking advantage of me and the most of the time they do.

I want to buy a new to me (so used) car. I have $5,000 saved up, and the car I have right now could probably get me $2,000. 

The cars I am looking at is a 2015 Mustang Ecoboost Premium (has all the nice leather and touch screen) that costs $16,500 and it has 43,000 miles on it. The other car is a 2017 Subaru WRX (premium) that costs $18,900 with 53,000 miles on it.

My car is a 2002 Toyota Solara with 197,000 miles on it. It’s not in horrible condition, but I think it’s time for an upgrade.

I am thinking about getting a loan for the rest of the money, which I can pay off as I have a job where I’ve worked for 3 years now. I can make the payments for the car and insurance per month which would round to roughly $860 a month where I am paid $1600 a month. I live at home so no rent or utilities all I pay for is insurance, phone, gas, food, and whatever else comes up.

Suntrust offered forbearance,  I called, in late March, made sense.

Learned more that could be a bigger negative unless really needed and especially not a government backed mortgage.

I just received the paperwork to sign just this past weekend, I wanted to ask a few questions and decide if I really want to do this and if not pay to get caught up and be done.

Well, easier said than done.  They gave us our dedicated rep and contact info:

Yeah right, I emailed her and it responds that she cant communicate via email for security reasons and to call.

They provide a direct extension, when you call, there is no option to enter one.

The queue says they are at capacity and about an 8hr wait, no option to wait, have to leave a number to call you back on.

We did so on Monday, it is now Wednesday and no call.

I called again this am and left my cell number, even though it says not to as it wont speed things up.

I feel to stuck and no way to address.  When I first called in March I waited 6.5hrs but did speak to someone.

Last month I called to check on the paperwork and only waited 2hrs and was told paperowrk would be here soon..

I feel that now they are avoiding people.

What can I do. I cant even pay online like I used to if I wanted to, it says I have to call.

I had a perfect payment history with them prior to this and dont want this to screw it up.

She was strongly considering ASU because they have an online program in her area of interest and experience (Media and Mass Comm), but to finish would be about 30k and 1.5-2 years. Of course, there are other programs like WGU and Northern Arizona University that have flat fees ($3000) for 6 month terms. However, they only offer Business degrees which are not as intriguing for her.

t3_gir3ma,Should I buy a house with my current income?,"So I'm 31 and make about $40,000 a year before taxes. After taxes, medical, 401k contributions, etc, I take home about $2100 a month. 

Currently I rent, which is $700 a month and includes all utilities. I have no debt whatsoever and my car is fully paid off.

Right now I'm looking at buying my first house which is proving to be rather intimidating. I have $10,000 saved up at the moment and the houses i'm looking at are in the $75,000 to $85,000 range. My credit score is 781 so I don't think getting a loan would be a problem. 

Anyway, for what I pay in rent, it would be cheaper on a month to month basis to own a home. On top of that, I would be moving to a 3 bedroom home up from a studio which would be a huge quality of life improvement. That and not having to hear noisy neighbors all the time.

Does now seem like a good time to buy? Or should I wait until I save more/make more? 

My main concerns are just not having a large savings before buying. If I do buy, should I use all $10,000 for a down payment? I know it's recommended to have 20% of the homes value for a down payment. Would I be able to use my mortgage for upfront costs at the time of purchase such as closing costs and initial moving expenses?

t3_gj1hl3,Housing Dilemma,"  Hi everyone, I’m not sure if this is the right place for this. If not please let me know. 

I was meant to start graduate school abroad this fall. That isn’t looking likely – however, I might be able to start in the spring (January). Currently my lease expires July 31. I could renew, but my apartment complex only does 12-month leases. I could renew my lease, but if I leave for the spring semester (January – May or June), then I would have to sublet my apartment. I don’t really have another choice – I couldn’t break the lease, and the apartment has already made it clear they won’t do month by month or a 6-month lease. I can’t afford any of the apartments with shorter leases in my city because shorter lease = more expensive rent. I can’t move back in with my family because my parents are deceased and my sister simply doesn’t have the room for me to be able to live with her. 

Is renewing my lease and banking on being able to sublet for the spring the right thing to do financially? Do I have any other options I’m not aware of? For reference, it’s a college town and if I stay here, I am guaranteed a job (will just continue with the one I have until I leave). I don’t know how coronavirus will affect this, but it’s generally pretty easy to find someone to sublet an apartment. There’s also the issue of – what if I renew my lease and it turns out I will be able to go abroad this fall? That’s extremely unlikely, I know, but if that happens I’d end up having to find someone to either take over my lease entirely or sublet from me for the whole year. 

I’m a college graduate and soon to be graduate student with not a lot of money and nowhere to go if I don’t figure something out myself, so figuring out my housing is extremely important.

What are our options?,"Hi all, hopefully this is appropriate to post here but I’m at a bit of a loss.

She is turning 65 in three weeks, and will be eligible for insurance coverage through Medicare, but as this occurred prior to that eligibility I don’t believe it will be covered. 

I am trying to figure out my options to help her, and it’s likely she’ll need to move in with me during her recovery until she regains any kind of mobility.

t3_gj1b5a,Ask my realtor to pay my inspection and attorney fees??,"Good morning everyone! First off, I would like to thank everyone in advance for taking the time to read and respond to this post. Second, I am a first time home buyer so please bear with me if this is a silly question. And the post is lengthy so I’m warning y’all in advance!

I told my parents the other day that the house I’m buying is a house that I found myself on Redfin and that I asked the realtor I was working with to schedule a showing for me - the past couple months that’s how it has been. My realtor sends me places through MLS and if I like a place, he’ll schedule or if I find a place on Zillow or Redfin then I’ll ask him to schedule a showing. So basically, my parents are saying since I found the place on Redfin myself and my realtor is there to just represent me that I should ask him to pay my inspection &amp; attorney fees. Furthermore, they went on to say that when they bought their home that my mom found our home while it was having an open house on her own while she was driving in the neighborhood and at that time she didn’t have a realtor so she put in an offer, got accepted but didn’t have someone to represent her so she called a realtor and the realtor told her that he would cover the inspection &amp; attorney costs. (This was in 2001) 

I see where they’re coming from but I’m kind of hesitant to ask my realtor because during this day and age, I think it’s pretty standard for home buyers to find places they like on Zillow/Redfin on their own and view them in addition to viewing places the realtor sends through MLS. I love my realtor, he has been extremely helpful and informative throughout the whole process and been representing me very well, I feel which is another reason why I’m hesitant to ask. That being said, I read somewhere that some people use a buyers agent that will refund the buyer a part of their commission. Knowing that information, I don’t think it would hurt to ask my realtor but I don’t want to offend him (of course I’ll ask in a way where it’s not offensive, if I do).

t3_gj1b2s,Should I invest or pay down debt?,"I hate my job. I hate corporate America. I want to do something that makes me happy and makes a difference in people’s lives. I’d much prefer a career in the non-profit sector, but their pay is pretty dismal compared to what I make in the private sector. I’ve told myself that when my husband and I are debt-free, I will quit the corporate grind. 

Our debts/interest rates/maturation date assuming no over-payment:

* Mortgage – 3.375% (2041)
* Husband’s student loans – 3.76% (2045)
* Car loan – 2.25% (2023)

My question is this:

Should I use my “extra income” (after bills, 401k contributions, and emergency fund) to:

1. Pay down these debts and quit my job when we are debt-free
2. Invest and quit my job when my investment pool &gt; my debts (using that pool to pay my remaining debts monthly/dampen the pain of a reduced income)

\#1 feels like the natural/obvious/easy choice, but am I losing the potential for ROI/free money?

\#2 I’m not totally sure how to do this. I don’t have thousands to invest right now, but I can set aside a few hundred a month (which would grow to around $1K/month once the car loan is gone). I’m not aware of an investment strategy that lets me invest a little a time and withdraw the money in around 5-10 years’ time without penalty.

t3_gj13iy,Should I prioritize savings over mortgage? Or pay more?,"The title is a bit misleading, as my mortgage is a loan from a relative. We agreed on an interest rate that is in between what bank mortgage interest would be and how much my relative would earn if he would leave the money in his savings account = 4% annually.

t3_gj10cj,Feeling uneasy about my sailboat mortgage,"I would like to hear your thoughts on my sailboat ownership situation. There may be no issue here, but I think I need some input anyway.
Just over a year ago I bought a 1988 41' sailboat that is my primary residence. I found a rather unique boat that had been both exceptionally cared for and received huge upgrades in the past 5 years. It was listed at twice the price of the other identical model year boats. I worked the seller down to a price about 60% above all of the other identical boats, and then had it surveyed. 
The surveyor gave it flying colors, he was very impressed. He valued the boat right at the price I had agreed to pay, and explained he had to find different boats to use as comps because this boat was in wildly better shape than the sister boats and had massive recent upgrades.
So I bought the boat and have loved every second I've owned it since. My girlfriend and I have taken it everywhere and continued to put in the hours to maintain it to perfection. 

The reason I post here, is while I can justify the boat and its value in my head, I seem to live with the constant stress that if I need to sell the boat in 2 or 3 years to have kids, will the next surveyor just value it at the other sister boats average sale price, 
 making me the fool for buying at a premium? 

I know its an open ended question, but it stresses me out every time I see another boat go on the market for half the price (albeit in poorer condition by far).

Some financial details if it helps:
- I paid 10% down.
- 3 years from now I will owe about what the poor condition boats are selling for, so I imagine I wouldn't owe cash upon sale no matter what (hopefully).",personalfinance,feeling uneasy sailboat mortgage,would like hear thought sailboat ownership situation may issue think need input anyway year ago bought sailboat primary residence found rather unique boat exceptionally cared received huge upgrade past year listed twice price identical model year boat worked seller price identical boat surveyed surveyor gave flying color impressed valued boat right price agreed pay explained find different boat use comp boat wildly better shape sister boat massive recent upgrade bought boat loved every second owned since girlfriend taken everywhere continued put hour maintain perfection reason post justify boat value head seem live constant stress need sell boat year kid next surveyor value sister boat average sale price making fool buying premium know open ended question stress every time see another boat market half price albeit poorer condition far financial detail help paid year owe poor condition boat selling imagine owe cash upon sale matter hopefully,feeling uneasy sailboat mortgage would like hear thought sailboat ownership situation may issue think need input anyway year ago bought sailboat primary residence found rather unique boat exceptionally cared received huge upgrade past year listed twice price identical model year boat worked seller price identical boat surveyed surveyor gave flying color impressed valued boat right price agreed pay explained find different boat use comp boat wildly better shape sister boat massive recent upgrade bought boat loved every second owned since girlfriend taken everywhere continued put hour maintain perfection reason post justify boat value head seem live constant stress need sell boat year kid next surveyor value sister boat average sale price making fool buying premium know open ended question stress every time see another boat market half price albeit poorer condition far financial detail help paid year owe poor condition boat selling imagine owe cash upon sale matter hopefully
t3_giqaqv,Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) first?,"Hi, I’m 24 years old and am currently contributing 15% of my income towards my employee sponsored Roth 401(k). They match up to 6% of my contributions which go to a Traditional 401(k).

t3_gj0khj,Debt payoff strategy (that is NOT avalanche or snowball),"Hello pf! LTLFTP, yadda yadda yadda...

I'm finally in a position where I can start to really focus on eliminating my (and my wife's) old credit card debt. Everything I'm reading focuses on snowball vs. avalanche methods and while I agree avalanche is better than snowball financially, I started thinking.

If the goal of all of this is to pay the least amount of interest, what if I take the monthly approach of throwing my extra money towards the CC that charges me the most interest in **that month**?

For example: Let's say I have $1000 above and beyond minimum payments to allocate to debt. 



Card | Balance | Rate | Monthly Interest
---|---|----|----|----
A | $8000 | 16.99% | $113.27
B | $9000 | 13.99% | $104.93 
C | $3900 | 26.99% | $87.72 
D | $4000 | 22.99% | $76.63 
E | $4750 | 15.24% | $60.33 
F | $2600 | 24.99% | $54.15 
G | $900 | 8.90% | $6.68 


Snowball would dictate I pay down to completion in this order: G, F, C, D, E, A, B

Avalanche dictates I would pay down to completion in this order: C, F, D, A, E, B, G

But what if instead you pay down by whichever account has the highest interest charge for that particular month? In the above table I would start with my $1000 applied to A. Then next month after paying down A it reaches the point where Card B has the higher interest charge for that month, so I apply my extra $1000 to that one, and so on until all accounts are paid off. So the target of $1k application changes month to month.

Does such a method exist, is it any more financially (forget morale) advantaged over avalanche, is there an online calculator so I can see how much better (or worse) this method is vs the others? I've been all over the place but unfortunately avalanche and snowball are so dominant/prominent that I can't find anything other than those two. I can breakdown this method very manually in a spreadsheet to get my answers but it's going to take a while because I'm not 100% sure how to do it easily in Excel and I don't want to [spend more time](https://xkcd.com/1205/) [developing](https://xkcd.com/1319/) the calculator than [doing the manual calculation](https://xkcd.com/1445/). So I'm leaning on the hive mind of Reddit to seek the enlightenment I desire.

Thanks all!

P.S. Yes, I know that's a lot of credit cards. Some were my wife's before we were together, some are mine, and we also have one we opened jointly. It's not relevant as to how/why they got this high, but I've been **trying** to pay these down for a long time and it seems I'm finally at a point I am able and I'll just leave it at that.

.

.

.


**EDIT**: Now with 100% more math! Okay, so numbers don't lie. Avalanche continues to be the numbers king. But it never hurts to ask the questions or we'll never find anyway to do things better.

For those curious (using my actual numbers) over the course of 12 months (because soon after accounts began getting to 0 balances and the calculations became slightly more complex) my proposed method paid out a total of $4919.65 in interest vs. Avalanche paid out $4367.63.

t3_gj0io9,Crazy to purchase house right now?,"My wife and I signed and put down earnest money to build a larger new house last November (2019).  I remember having a long conversation with my father saying ""I hope the economy doesn't collapse between now and then"".  We put down $2500 and paid an additional $850 for inspections, so we are in it for $3350 and our realtor said we could walk away at any point if we are willing to lose our earnest money.

We have been living in a 1400 sqft home for 5 years that we have outgrown since our kiddo was born.  We paid $249k for it, owe about $180k, and in the pre-corona market, we would probably sell for about $300k since it is a newer home in a great part of town.  Homes in our area are still selling, but our new home won't be available until late July, and who knows what will happen between now and then.

Our prospective new home is priced at $344k, and we have 20% down (\~$66k), and were planning on using equity from current home and doing a recast after our current home sells, meaning we would have an additional $80-90k \[ideally\] to put towards principal (approximately 42% down).  We are approved at 3.5% interest rate, and can buy down the rate as low as 2.75% with an additional \~$10k at closing.  

For what it is worth, we plan to stay in this house for a very long time -- possibly as long as to see our little one off to college.

I have a number of reservations about this whole process.

1. We are buying into a market at the inflated home price from last fall, and that may (will?) not last
2. We will need to sell our existing home, and might not be able to sell for what we want/need
3. Our jobs are both stable, but that could change at any given time given the uncertainty of covid

t3_giogoh,Am I keeping too much in my emergency fund?,"So quick background: I'm married and have 1 child. I make a little over 100k a year and my wife brings in about 30k from her part time job and maybe another 30-40k from her other job (running a horse barn). I work in the auto industry, so things are a bit shaky right now which has me wondering on what I should do in my current situation.

My wife and I really don't have any debt other than a mortgage and both of our car payments. I have about 55k in an Ally savings account (where the interest used to be much better than it is right now). I end up saving almost 1k a month in that account, once it's average out throughout the year. The Ally account is pretty much my emergency fund, as I keep a separate Chase account that pays off the CC bills every month which most all of our bills go through. There is somewhere are 3-4k in there right now.

On to my question, I figure that to have about 12 months of funds to keep us going if I lose my job here would be about 40k to keep (15yr mortgage is about $2500, plus our car payments and other monthly expenses I came to about $3500 a month). My wife's job(s) are both extremely secure, so no worry about that. Does this seem about right? I'd like to potentially pay off the car loans as those are the only higher interest loans we have at about 4.5%. I'd also like to do some repairs around the house and would like to dip into the money we have saved up.

Also, I currently max out my 401k every year as well as my HSA. The only thing not being maxed out is the 529 for my kid, which maybe I should start doing though he just turned 1.

Pretty much what I'm looking for is in this current environment, how many months should I be looking to hang on to in the emergency fund?

t3_gj0dzh,"Question about interest rates and the amount that comes off of the principle, numbers don't seem to be moving the right way.","I track the exact date of my monthly bill payments and what the new principle amount of debt is in a spreadsheet. For example, I have a personal loan and a car loan that I pay the exact same amount on every month.

I would expect the amount that is applied to the principle to go up every month because there is less to charge interest on, right?

Their products are ridiculously overpriced so any purchases made will be strictly for keeping the account alive and increasing FH credit limit.

Curious on what shipping charges would be, I filtered items in the Clearance section by price and the cheapest item was a $5 infant type toy that attaches to your finger. I don't have any infants or babies in the house and would just toss the toy in the trash when I get it. I put that in the shopping cart and went to check out. Lo and behold, they want to charge me $25 JUST for shipping for a toy smaller than the size of an adult hand. Yeah, it's to Hawaii, but still. 

I still want to try and 'work' this Fingerhut system as its a much cheaper solution than a Secured Card, for increase in available credit you get. I started to check the site to see if there were possibly any digital purchases that doesn't require shipping. Maybe a movie or gift card. I couldn't find anything of the sort, but was curious if anyone had any other ideas on how to make this site work, without having to pay insane shipping costs.

t3_gizohr,NYC management company trying to strong arm me into accepting lease terms,"Hoping anyone might have some insight for courses of action for me on this one. I rent an apartment in NYC, have been with this management company for 3 years, and in this unit for 2. I have always paid my rent on time, if not early, and my credit score has just recently crossed into the excellent range, which feels good. My lease is up June 1, and I received my renewal end of March, you know, right when a certain virus hit New York kind of hard. Thankfully, due to my career being a pretty in-demand profession and essential work (I'm a veterinarian and people love their pets), I am still working and don't have any real fear of job loss or insecurity. However, my annual raise will likely be minimal, if it will happen at all, so my wages will likely be stagnant, which I'm sure is the case for many workers right now fortunate enough to still be employed. Nevertheless, the management company proposed a rent increase of about $100 a month, which, in a normal year would be annoying but tolerable with increased wages, and would correspond with inflation I suppose. But this is not a normal year. I have tried to reach out to the management company about 6 times at this point to re-think this rent increase and have been met with absolute silence - my emails and calls go unanswered, and when I reached out to the leasing office, all they did was send me right back to the renting office who have failed to answer me. When I asked the leasing office for a different email address because that one is not answering me, they also stopped answering my emails.

At this point I feel stuck and a little nervous. I don't want to have no lease and be at risk of eviction, but I also know I am an excellent tenant and don't want to be strong armed into paying what isn't really fair given the drastically changed economic landscape of the city, and the world. I don't know what to do and was actually wondering if I should send back the leasing agreement unsigned with a message to reconsider? I don't even know if I have any rights here. Can anyone offer any advice?

t3_giz46l,Credit Score Help,"I've come to this subreddit looking for help, guidance, and/or a better understanding of credit and my current FICO score.

&amp;#x200B;

I regularly monitor my FICO score through my bank's website. Over the last month, it dropped 19 points and I'm trying to understand why. My bank doesn't offer any guidance other than a phone number to call Experian, which does not seem to have a path to an actual human. I've considered ordering/accessing a report, but I honestly don't know/understand if/how this would affect my score.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I expected that, if anything, my credit score would have gone up. I haven't had a late payment on anything in years. I haven't recently opened nor applied for any new lines of credit. The only things that have changed is that I paid the last payment on my auto loan last month and did not pay on my student loans (so far, for one month) as a result of the CARES Act. I verified that no student loan payment was showing as due before that date came and went. I wouldn't have thought that either of these would bring my credit score down.

&amp;#x200B;

Any information or advice is appreciated.

t3_giraso,Can I negotiate salary package for a new position at the same company?,"Very long story short - I was promised a promotion at my current company, on my current team, in my current role back in February. Was told “all the executive approvals” required were signed/sealed/delivered. Then nothing for weeks.  I’d consistently followed up when all of a sudden I saw an open job positing at my company- for the same position I would have been promoted to. 

My bosses have assured me I’m not losing my current role but they also encouraged me to apply for the role as an internal candidate to “prove I’m willing to compete against anyone for a promotion” and because in light of COVID they aren’t sure the promotion I’ve already been approved for “will go through” (???) I think that’s messed up, but I have applied and so far moved steadily through the interview process with my current bosses. 

My question is - aside from how duplicitous and bogus this situation is - if I get the job, what are some ways I negotiate the salary package in my favor? I already know I’m being paid under what others in my company are for similar work (hence pushing for a promotion to begin with).

t3_giz2bd,Parents paying minimum on private student loans--not sure how much to put towards them,"Basically title. I make right at 100k/year gross right now, pay 2k in rent each month, and have approximately 45k in student loans. Half is a private loan with a \~5.5% interest rate, the other half are a smattering of federal loans ranging from 3.5% to 4.5%.

Right now I am maxing my Roth IRA and putting 10% into my Roth 401k. I pay slightly above the minimum payment on the federal loans (currently funneling it into my emergency fund during COVID forbearance and will be applying all of it towards the federal loans at the end of the forbearance period).

My parents make the minimum monthly payment on the private loans, about $230 per month. I am fully responsible for the federal loans.

With the economy so uncertain, my general dislike of being in debt, and given the fact that I (currently) don't anticipate being laid off, I am considering halting IRA contribs, lowering my 401k contribs to the employer match, and avalanching all of that money into the private loans until they're gone, and then the federal loans. I still put about 1k/month away in my savings account for short term goals (a car and a pilot's license).

Is this a good idea? I'm hesitant to spend so much money paying off the private loans since my parents will *theoretically* pay them until they're gone, and I could use that money for other things (like retirement, as I have been doing), but I have no way of knowing that for certain. Any advice about what to do would be appreciated.

t3_giyucy,When will I be able to build my own ETF portfolio?,"Hello everyone,

I think this situation is common for many people lately: In these days I am considering starting a general investment plan with an eventual accumulation plan on [Moneyfarm](https://www.moneyfarm.com/uk/). Ideal plan: start with a deposit of 10-15k (maybe in separate installments over 3-5 months to diversify more) and leave it alone for 15-25 years (when I'll be 40-50 years old). At the same time, I am considering to invest on my own on Degiro or Directa (for Italy). I made a quick calculation, not counting the ETFs that have no fees. Considering my starting budget of 10-15k, the fee costs would be around 35-66€ for the inital buy of 7 ETFs. Each subsequent year, I would like to add a budget of 2.4k as part of the accumulation plan, so my annual fees should then amount to 20-66€ + ETFs costs for 7-14 entries per year (1-2 entries per year for 7 ETFs).  MoneyFarm (1% per year on capital + ETF costs, so 1.28%). Of course this calculation is not considering the ETFs that you can buy without fees, which would drastically make my DIY option a lot cheaper, but I made the calculation anyway since I don't know which ETFs are best for my situation.

Looking at JustETF, I realized that I don't have the basis for making a precise and safe asset allocation. I'm not a beginner in finance/economy and I know a few things, but as I said I don't feel ready. On paper I know how to diversify and other principles, but then when it comes to the concrete knowledge I simply which specific ETFs I could use to build my portfolio. The only thing that I know is I want accumulative type ETFs and I want them to be ""reliable"".

So I was wondering, how long does it take to learn how to correctly build a serious portfolio? Moneyfarm seems like a reliable option that builds a portfolio with professional and well-kept criteria, and chooses the right financial instruments. Considering this comparison, how long would it take for me to do a job like theirs on my own? We are talking about savings that I would like to grow over time and not squander through poor choices. Lastly, where can I cultivate my knowledge about ETFs? Also, should I consider a pension fund instead of this..?

t3_giyobu,Does asset allocation across Roth/non-Roth accounts matter during growth phase?,"Hi all. I searched and found a few relevant threads, but I am still a bit confused on if this should matter at this point in my life. I have several retirement accounts. The IRA and Solo 401(K) are Roth; the account through work (essentially a 401(K)) is not. 

Previous posts indicate that you'd want to put the stuff projected to grow more (i.e. stocks) in Roth and stuff projected to grow less (i.e. bonds) in traditional. I guess I'm still a bit confused on whether the allocation across the accounts actually matters in the here-and-now. Since all accounts are growing tax-free and I can freely rebalance across them before the Traditional gets taxed on withdrawal, I feel like I should be allocating them by choosing the few things in my Traditional work 401(K) that have low expense ratios and then making up the rest of the allocation in my Roth.

t3_giynxd,Advice about taking a new job and having to owe relocation back on my current one,"So I’m in a bit of a situation. I’m 24 years old and I just relocated on a $7,000 relocation package with my current company about two months ago which states I have to be in the role for two years, and that it’s prorated on a daily basis so I would end up owing around $6k still if I left this month. The job I have now is not what I expected, but I’m managing. I’m out here in the new town completely alone, which has taken a toll on my mental health. Again, I’m managing, but I feel like I’m just trying to keep my head above water. I’ve been with this company for almost four years, worked my way up into a management role and went from making about 25k to 66k a year and have a decent amount of stocks. I feel like I owe them, for helping me get this far, so I have a lot of guilt over leaving. 

The new company wants to offer me a $4.5k relocation package to move back to my home town, as well as $5.5k in stocks every year and a $10.8-13.9k annual bonus. My base salary would be $68k but my total compensation would be $89k, while my current role is only $74k. The new job is within the same line of business (customer fulfillment) however, I would be doing QA management and have a significantly smaller team and more ability to work on my own personal growth. This week, I also get about $5k in stocks from my current company that I could use to offset the relo I’m going to have to pay back. I don’t have much in savings, about $7k because I still have student loans and minor CC debt, but that is also an option. 

Ultimately, with my current company I thought transitioning into a new role would help me feel a little less burnt out, yet I still do. My current company is huge, and gets a lot of bad media, so the culture has gotten very bad in many areas. 

Not exactly sure what the best move is - I think I would be much happier in a QA role and moving back to be near my family and friends but it comes at a price. I also am extremely scared to tell my current manager about the new job (if I take it) because I’m afraid it looks so bad that I came here for only two months before leaving. But what I’m doing now is not something I’m passionate about. Since this has been my only long term job, I’m hesitant to make this decision quickly, but I have to let the other company know my decision soon. Can anyone give me some guidance? Have you ever had to pay back relo? If so what was it like? Would I be making a bad decision moving back? I can’t imagine being with my current company for another two years.

I underwent a bone marrow transplant to treat it and I'm currently recovering. I used a GoFundMe and my savings to pay for my treatment but that money's all gone.

I have a Senior Analyst role at a big consulting firm and I went back to working part time and remotely. The job has great benefits and pays me pretty well. I get about $800 every two weeks working part time and then $2000 every two weeks working full time (starting in July). I don't have a lot of expenses:

- Student Loans = $371 / month
- Rent = $500 / month (I moved in with my parents after I got sick and this is how I help them run the house)
- Rent = $1500 (one time expense for the last month of my NYC apartment)
- Credit Card - $200/month

t3_giydso,Forced to quit due to losing child care.,"I started a new job in January and all was going well. My wife and I have a 1.5 year old son who was being cared for by our sister-in-law. When COVID hit, Michigan shut down on 3/13 and I had been off work until this past Monday, 5/11. When I told my sister-in-law that I was going back to work (had one weeks notice) she was reluctant but said things have to get back to normal at some point.

My wife has a very secure job and after going over our budget, accounting for every dime we spend on mortgage, student loan, utilities, Netflix and others, groceries, phone, and gas, we will have about $850 left every month.

t3_giy5li,Affording a Lawyer,"A while ago, I posted in here about some property that I inherited through a trust, and how I want out of it. I hired a lawyer and paid him to get more information about my options, and he did a great job, but in order to proceed he wants $4000 for him to be put on retainer for 10 hours of work. 

My goal is to sell my shares of the company that was made around the trust, which I estimate are worth about 150k to 200k. Obviously $4000 is nothing compared to the potential results of this situation, and considering all of the facts it seems like at the end of it all I will walk away with way more than I am spending. However, I don't have $4000, and the payment plan offered by the lawyer really maxes out my budget. Essentially all of my money that isn't going to rent or bills will go to this for the next four months.

t3_gixtwk,House Refinance Question - Need Guidance,"Hey everyone, my wife posted the below yesterday. Seems like a sound decision, but we're inexperienced when it comes to refinancing so really appreciate any guidance from the sub. Thanks!

///BREAK///

My husband and I have a 30-year VA mortgage with an interest rate of 3.75%. We’re considering refinancing through a VA “Streamline” or IIRL but aren’t sure whether or not it’s worth it because while we aren’t looking to move any time soon, this house isn’t our “forever home.” 

We called around for quotes and the best we received was from our current lender, who offered a 30-year rate of 2.825% with a monthly savings of $661, which we would immediately then re-apply to our monthly payment as principal, essentially keeping our monthly payment the same, but paying off the loan slightly earlier, and reducing the amount of interest paid over the life of the loan by about $184K. All we’d be on the hook for at closing would be rolled into the new loan, which is $5K, so we’d break even within the first year.   

It seems like all of this makes sense, and we’ve been with this lender for 8 years now with absolutely no issues, but are there additional questions we should be asking that might change our decision?",personalfinance,house refinance question need guidance,hey everyone wife posted yesterday seems like sound decision inexperienced come refinancing really appreciate guidance sub thanks break husband year mortgage interest rate considering refinancing streamline iirl sure whether worth looking move time soon house forever home called around quote best received current lender offered year rate monthly saving would immediately apply monthly payment principal essentially keeping monthly payment paying loan slightly earlier reducing amount interest paid life loan hook closing would rolled new loan break even within first year seems like make sense lender year absolutely issue additional question asking might change decision,house refinance question need guidance  everyone wife posted yesterday seems like sound decision inexperienced come refinancing really appreciate guidance sub thanks break husband year mortgage interest rate considering refinancing streamline iirl sure whether worth looking move time soon house forever home called around quote best received current lender offered year rate monthly saving would immediately apply monthly payment principal essentially keeping monthly payment paying loan slightly earlier reducing amount interest paid life loan hook closing would rolled new loan break even within first year seems like make sense lender year absolutely issue additional question asking might change decision

t3_gin9fq,Planning ahead as a Flight Attendant who's been out on Worker's Compensation,"Hi All! I am currently employed in good standing with a US domestic airline as a flight attendant. However, due to a workplace injury, I have been out for almost 2 years and receiving worker's compensation benefits. In a few weeks, I will have reached the 2 year mark and will no longer receive work comp payments. After that, I will be applying for California state disability benefits. I cannot apply for disability until 7 days before my current worker's compensation benefits end, and I have no idea what my benefits for disability will look like, assuming I am granted any.  

Ok so:  I finish up spinal post-operation physical therapy with a goal of returning to work around August, but possibly delayed to the fall. Unfortunately, it is looking like my Airline will have furloughs starting October, very close to when I hoped to finally be back full time. 

In the interest of planning ahead, my question is regarding **what will count as 'income' when I do file for unemployment.**  

* 2 years of worker's compensation payments. 
* small, not steady monthly paychecks from my company, usually under $200. These were infrequent and only so I could stay on company health insurance, etc. They were taxed accordingly. 
* Possible Disability payments I would receive in a few weeks, between when work comp ends and until returning to work
* If I am able to return to work for a month or two before furloughs occur, payroll then would of course count towards past income. (side question, is it in my interest to work as much as possible if I return for even a month to help boost my 'past income'?)

I appreciate your help. I cannot find a straight answer online, on the California EDD website, or even from my attorney.

t3_gih008,"My roommate abandoned our apartment. Didn't pay rent, caused damages. Need advice on what to do next.","I am in a pretty bad situation right now and I am looking for advice about whether I should stay in this two bedroom apartment and find another roommate, or if I should move to a one bedroom apartment in June. 

-----

What happened with my roommate: She moved out last week, didn't pay rent for May, and has left over $1500 in damages to the master. The full story is posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/gaq19p/colorado_us_my_roommate_is_attempting_to_break/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/gg6ezg/roommate_moved_out_with_no_warning_did_not_pay/).

I am paying her half of the rent today and I understand I have to pay for the damages to the master. I intend to take this matter to small claims, but it looks like it could take years to recover the money. In the meantime, I need help deciding what I should do. 

-----



**Option 1**: My leasing office is working with me, thankfully. They are not charging late fees and they are giving me the option to transfer to a one bedroom apartment. They are also giving me the option to break up the $1500 into 12 payments if I move to a one bedroom and sign a new 12 month lease. The one bedroom apartment costs $1150/m (before utilities). If I take this option, I will $1275/m over the next year. I would also need to pack and hire movers (I'm on the 4th floor and the only one bedroom they have is on the 3rd floor of a different building).

**Option 2**: Stay in the two bedroom and find another roommate. This unit costs $1475/m (before utilities) total, which I am paying by myself for May. With a roommate, I only pay $737.5/m in rent. I still have to pay $1500 to have the bedroom repaired, which can be broken up into 12 payments. However, I can't have a new roommate move into the master bedroom until it's repaired. The carpet needs to be replaced, walls re-painted, and the bathroom counters need to be re-surfaced. The apartment manager doesn't know how quickly they will be able to get this done, or if their vendors are able to do work in an occupied apartment due to COVID-19. If they can't do it, I have to find a way to make that bedroom livable on my own... and I don't think I can. Finding a new roommate also puts me at risk for this to happen again. This roommate was the second roommate to abandon the apartment with out notice in the last 9 months. The roommate before had a mental break down and went to live with family. While this is understandable, I still got screwed paying his half of the rent for a month.

I am a full time student and I will graduate in May of next year. At that point, I will either be going on to grad school or I'll be working full time in my new career. Right now, I work for the university part time making $13/hr. I can't work more than 30 hours a week as a full time student, and realistically, I can't work more than 20 hours a week with out compromising my performance in class. I am supplementing my income with scholarships, grants, and student loans. I'm on SNAP and Medicaid as well. I budget every dollar in 6-month increments to align with financial aid disbursements in January and August. It's barely enough to cover CoL. 


TL;DR: Roommate abandoned the lease and now I have to pay $1500 to have her bedroom repaired before I can find a new roommate. I am also paying double rent until the room is repaired. The apartment manager is offering to let me transfer to a one bedroom which will cost $400/m more than splitting a two bedroom with a roommate. I'm full time student barely making ends meet. Should I stay in the two bedroom and find a roommate if/when the repairs are made or move to the one bedroom?

t3_givsng,How would you split this rent?,"Hi, I'm speaking to some potential roommates and we have a disagreement on how rent should be split. Here is our situation: the apartment would be a 2B2B, with one room being a double, the other a triple, and someone taking the entire living space (not including kitchen area and small dining table). I would say that each room and the outside living/kitchen space are about the same size. Here's the thing, the bathrooms are located inside each of the bathrooms, so the person in the living room will have to walk back and forth of the double to use that bathroom. Additionally, they will store half their things in the double as well. Question might be why doesn't this person just move into the double? Well, if there's a space for someone to sleep peacefully by themselves, why not use it?

So I tried looking at how to calculate square feet, or using the bidding method website but I just can't get anything to work reasonably. If we were to say that rent was 4000/month, how would you guys divide this? Thanks in advance.

t3_givpmk,"Is 30 years of $25,500/year enough to retire comfortably?","33 year old, no savings or assets other than an old beater car. Starting from scratch. 

Starting this year, I am on track to contribute $19,500 to a Traditional 403-B and $6,000 to a Roth IRA.

Over the years as my pay increases, I will have to cut back on the overtime to prevent physical &amp; mental burn out, so I don't think I will ever make more money total than I am now.

However, I've checked Credit Karma, Chase Credit Journey, and annualcreditreport.com and recognize all of my current debts listed. To line it up, I have an auto loan, mortgage, two student loans, and one credit card with balances. I have a few store cards all reporting no balance. All of these accounts are in good standing and again, the five I've listed are the only ones with an actual balance. My score has not gone down at all.

t3_gijq0h,I'm being given Stock but I have no idea what I'm doing?,"So a bit of background and questions:

So long story short, my mom dated/lived with a guy for many years.  I lived with them for a bit after I graduated from college, and during this time my mom got cancer and myself her boyfriend (we'll call him Dan) and I took care of her. He worked and I stayed in to take care of her until she passed and we became very close.  He's like a second father to me.  Well his Dan's Dad passed and left him a size-able amount of stock, of which was willed 7 of his children inlcuding Dan.  One of Dan's fathers wishes was to have his children also do the same for 7 people and since Dan has no kids I guess I'm it.   


He rang and told me to make an account with Schwab and to send him the 8 numbers after detailing the amount of shares he was going to give.  I don't know anything about the Stock except its current value, and there's about 125 shares of it for now, and every year in January he's going to give me more.  I'ts not millionaire numbers but if I'm smart now it could take care of me in retirement many many years down the road.  


So what kind of account do I need to open?  The Schwab website was so confusing.  On the Make an Account Page it has so many options.  Is it a Brokerage?  I think I'll just continue to live on my job's earnings and maybe learn how to invest or at least watch the value go up or go down for a bit since the market sounds like its all over the place right now.  I could use the money to start paying off my student loans which is a huge goal for me as I move into my 30's.  


Any advice or help is valued.  Also I know a lot of people are struggling right now and I hope this isn't tone deaf or insensitive.

t3_gip2vg,"Called collections agency for my Grandma, concerned they might come after me now","Hello everyone, I hope you are all healthy and happy, tldr at bottom

So my grandma had a small debt that went to collections, that she supposedly settled already, from what she tells me. She got a letter from some agency, saying if she paid a certain amount by a certain date, that the debt would be settled. She ended up sending the amount in the mail, and got the post office to stamp something for her proving she sent it on the day she did. Only problem is she sent it like 2 days late. 

Now a seemingly different firm sent her a letter recently saying they were going to take it to court. I told her it was probably because she sent it 2 days late. Anyway, I told her I wanted to help her out for mothers day and see if I could figure anything out. 

I called the number on the letter, and told this lady that I was calling for my grandma, and wanted to know why the debt isnt settled yet. She asked me my name, and I gave her my first name. Then she said that in order for her to talk about the debt with me, my grandma needed to give her permission. So i gave the phone to my grandma, she gave them the last 4 of her social, and her name. Then they asked her for my name again. I motioned to her to not give them my last name but she said it anyway by mistake (shes 80 years old, not as fast as she used to be I guess, she apologized though). Then I grabbed the phone from her and asked the lady for any information. Then she kept telling me the conversation was being recorded, and kept asking me for my social security number. Alarm bells were going off in my head. I hung up without giving her any more information of mine.

My concern is, was she trying to somehow attach me to the account, so they could go after me for the money in the event my grandma couldnt pay? The only information of mine they have is my first and last name (for all they know its fake), they do not have my address, social, dob, or anything else besides knowing im related to my grandma. I dont think I can help my grandma with this at all, she should get an attorney right? 

TLDR: Called collections agency for my grandma to try and figure out what is going on. They were shady the whole time and I hung up without learning anything useful. They have my first and last name, and nothing else. Should I be worried about them coming after me for the money? Should my grandma hire an attorney?

t3_gis0mc,Trying to start planning my finances and feeling overwhelmed,"I work as a teacher and my wife works as a nurse. We have stable careers and a combined take home of around 150k.

We had an opportunity at age 24 (her 25) to buy a home, so we spent the money we saved for a wedding on the downpayment and remodel of our home. We were a bit over our heads with it, not financially, but more in terms of being homeowners. It was a great deal on the smallest house in an amazing neighborhood that has doubled in value since we bought it.

However, because of the amount of remodeling we had to do to it, we've just spent a lot of money on short term 0% loans to cover things like appliances, floors, and other remodeling things.

Now, four years later, we are in a position where our budget is very stable after several years of salary growth with very little debt. I'm looking to refinance my home and start saving for retirement, while not affecting our short terms saving goals (as we still need around 60k in remodeling to ""finish"" the house entirely).

29 has kind of snuck up on me, and I know I should've invested earlier than now, but I want to get started.

1. Refinancing my home.

My current home loan was originally 198k at 4.25% fixed, and the current principal is at 182. I talked to quicken loans and their offer estimate for a 15 year was 2.875% but they are looking to add 12k to my note in closing costs. 5400 for an escrow account and 6600 for their closing fees and whatever points they are paying down, which is unclear to me as of yet. It feels like I shouldn't need escrow and the closing costs seem very high as well. I should definitely shop around for this, right? 


I'm not sure I want to throw 12k paying those up front, but at the same time the escrow account from my current mortgage should cover the 5400 for the new escrow (I did check the balance), but that still leaves their 6600 fees. The paperwork estimate he sent was for the 30 year (I was exploring both options) and says 2pts paid down and 1600 in fees, with an interest rate on the 30 year of 3.375. Seems like I should have a better interest rate than that at this point. The original loan was with 10% down, a much higher debt to incom ratio, much worse credit, and much worse rates at the time (Feb 2016). Now we both have 800+ credit scores and they are offering me 3.875 as my interest rate before I pay it down? That seems like I'm being ripped off, but again I know nothing.

2. Setting up my retirement.

My dad says RothIRA. I think my wife and I are pretty capped at our current levels of income. She won't be making much more in her current position, I probably won't be breaking 70k any time soon. Is a RothIRA the right choice for us? 

Should I dump the 6k max for the year in right now for both of us, while the market is at a low, or stick to 1000$ a month this year and go to 500$ a month next year? Does that even matter? 

Are there any better investment options for my situation?


The only other debt we have currently is our car payment of 400 a month.

We're currently renting, and saving around £350 each a month for the deposit. We aim to save just shy of £8k a year in total. I'm pretty new to how mortgages work exactly, so please bear with me.

My question is, is it better to try and get a 5% deposit on a house, put up with the poor interest rate during the initial term, and then remortgage; or wait an extra few years until we have enough for a 10% deposit?

My thinking is that the £11k we spend a year on rent could be going towards paying off the mortgage early... that seems obvious to me. Are there any downsides to this that I should be aware of? I know the interest rate is poor on 5% deposit mortgages, but if you can remortgage after 2-5 years anyway, why don't more people do that? Or is there something I'm missing?

t3_giur6p,"About to get a small inheritance, still owe on mortgage - suggestions for growing wealth?","Quick rundown:

(all figures are in Australian, bear in mind cost of living is higher in Aus than US)

* Single child, 2 adult family, currently single income of $80k (clear about $5100/month). Child is very early school, parents are late 40s (we started late)
* Owe $415k on $750k house
* Owe $25k on 2 credit cards
* Second smaller income will begin within 6 months probably.
* Zero savings.
* Within the next few months I expect to get about $300k inheritance which I believe is totally tax free in Australia.

What I know about finance: 

pay off your debts!!! Obvs the credit cards have gotta go immediately. (These are left over from a small business, normally we don't have credit cards at all)

Next would be to pay off mortgage as much as possible.

What I would like to know however, is what kind of options might be good for using the equity we would then have in the house to try to build some wealth over the next 5-10 years.

We'd like to upgrade our house situation, but I understand moving to a bigger/nicer place is then going to put our mortgage back up higher, just for more ""niceness"".

t3_girjgp,Tax Impact on ROTH/Traditional IRA Contribution,"Hey guys! First post here because I'm hoping a better understanding of this can help me in future years to make the best decision for myself and my family. My wife and I, both in our mid-20's, just got married in October and both make over $10,000 a year (important later, I promise). Since this is our first time filing taxes as a couple, I tried to see what our returns would be filing separately vs jointly. Turns out we would have gotten an extra $600 back filing separately, mostly in state tax return. Or so I thought until I added in my ROTH IRA contributions. For whatever weird reason, married filing separately has an income cap of $10,000 in order to contribute to a ROTH without a 6% penalty, enforced every year until the money is removed from the account?? And even if you contribute to a traditional, it may end up not be tax-deductible? What is this about? Outside of preventing couples in similar situations from filing separately to increase their tax return, what is the point of this? For context, married filing jointly and filing as single both have income caps in excess of $100,000 for ROTH IRA contributions.

t3_gijj15,"Accidentally removed myself from employer-provided health insurance plan (California, Santa Clara county)","Hello everyone! Hope you and your loved ones are well and safe. 

**TLDR -**   
**Accidentally removed myself from the employer-provided health insurance plan, feeling pretty vulnerable, physically with covid and mentally with the potential expenses if I get sick for what so ever reason -  what are my options?**

My partner got a new job and since their employer provides health insurance benefits, I wanted to take them off of my employer's Kaiser plan. In the process, I, unfortunately, removed myself too. The bigger mistake, I did not read the selections email either. This happened in March 1st week. 

I realized that this has happened when I tried to reorder a prescription this month and got an automated call that my membership has been terminated.

I am trying to appeal this with my employer's benefits provider and in the meanwhile wanted to tap into the hive mind here to understand what my other options are. The current situation adds more soup to my situation and I am legit scared right now. The appeal timeline is typically 30 days and I am trying to find a solution for the interim. Here's what I have thought of so far -  

1. I explored is to add myself to my partner's plan but if I put the qualifying event data as of March, the system tells us that this is out of the 31-day window in which we can register for a qualifying event. 
2. I started looking up insurance providers online and they are expensive and very confusing. Even after paying hundreds of dollars, the coverage is quite limited and the out of pocket is sky-high.

So I am looking for advice on the following - 

* Is there anything else I can do or explore in addition to the above options while I wait for the appeal to come back?
* Can I put in a date that is in the 31-day window for option 1 above? I am pretty sure the answer is no but I wanted to check anyway. (I am kinda desperate here).
* Any resources/companies/plans that offer decent coverage at reasonable prices if I want to buy something in the interim or heck, even for the rest of the year in the worst case?

t3_gimqfc,Buy new home now or wait one-two more years,"Hello personalfinance!

Long time lurker here, wanted to get your guys input on my current situation.  Currently own a 2 bedroom condo in Southern California, but looking to upgrade to a single family home with at least 3 bedrooms.  Would you guys recommend pulling the trigger now and getting in to a new home or wait it out a few more years to save more of a down payment?

Here is a breakdown of our current situation:

* Household income: $210K ($140K me, $70K wife), both in stable jobs, take home is about $10K a month, with bonuses quarterly of $5K - take home about $2.7K after taxes
* Down payment savings = $105K ($35K + \~$70K in equity at the moment in our condo)
* Current mortgage w/ HOA fee: $3,154 (tax and insurance is impounded)
* CC Debt: $0, all other expenses budgeted monthly: $2,500-$3,000 which includes all entertainment expenses as well
* No kids at the moment, have family that has committed to day care once that is part of the plan down the road

We are looking at houses in the $750K range but I am hesitant to take our mortgage too high. I know we would have to pay a chunk for PMI but I am confident that the mortgage calculators are overestimating what our PMI would be monthly. Would it make sense to get in to the new house now without a full 20% down payment?  I know rates are very low right now and am confident we could secure a great rate. Or would you recommend waiting a few more years to save up that full 20% to avoid PMI cost.

t3_giakhe,Am I crazy to buy a house that I can't afford now but can afford in a couple years?,"I'll be as concise as possible. Just got a job (very secure government job) that will start training as soon as restrictions are lifted here in Ontario, Canada. Salary will be $54k while training for 5 months, $72k when training is done, and then $10k raise per year until I hit $100k after 42 months.There is a spectacular forever-home available right now for $650k. We have $105k saved and can borrow $100k from parents.IF (big if), I can get a mortgage from the credit union (5 year, 2.89%) associated with my new job, is it crazy to buy the house, knowing that we'd just scrape by for the first year, but then get more and more comfortable each year? After 4 years, I estimate my monthly net earnings will be \~$2k ($6k in the door, $4k out the door). Soon after that, my wife will be able to start working again as the kids will be in school. She works in the medical field and can work as much or as little as she wants at about $40/hr.Also, we would plan to keep \~30-40k in our pocket if we bought the house, just in case.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Thanks to your advice, I'm not going to pursue this house. A lot of the advice against it didn't take into account some pertinent details that I forgot to include (my fault), but a few good comments convinced me that I just can't afford it. Also, I've realized that we all have some regional biases that affect how we think. Around here, $650k is a steal for a house. If you can't afford $550k, the dream of home ownership is dead, and that's a hard reality to face. Nevertheless, it's reality. Thanks for participating in the discussion.

Previous edits:To be clear, ""forever home"" maybe means something different to me. I just mean that it's a 4 bedroom, and we only plan to have 2 kids, so we would never ""need"" to upsize, as opposed to a 2bed house that would only work for a while. Also, to give some local (Toronto-ish) perspective, $650k is sadly a good deal on a house around here. I've been eyeing the market closely for 3 years, and this house is crazy cheap. It's in immaculate condition and all of the big ticket items are new.

t3_gimgz6,An attacker accessed my bank accounts and transferred money out. I don't know what to do.,"
May 2nd I found out someone had accessed my savings account and made a series of transfers out of the account without my knowledge. This started April 17th. I called my bank and disputed the charges. Then I found out 2 additional accounts were accessed and had money transferred out of them. I called those banks and reported the fraud. Then I found out the attacker also accessed my email and created filtering rules to delete email notifications about transfers from those three banks.

I formatted my computer which is my only suspicion for how this happened. I changed all my passwords. I froze my credit with all 3 bureaus. I also added a fraud alert to all 3 bureaus. I pulled my free credit report to verify no additional lines of credit had been created. I also filed a police report with my local police department. 

The 3 banks did refund the money to my accounts, contingent on an ongoing investigation. By all rights they should find the transfers really were fraudulent, but it makes me really nervous they could rule against me and then I'd have to escalate somehow. 

Then over the next few days I received bank cards from new bank accounts in my name. The first was for a ""Stride Bank / Chime Me"" Bank. I had never heard of this bank before. The money from the first savings account was transferred to this ""Stride Bank"" but I do not know how the attacker planned to access the money. 

Then I received another bank card from ""Green Dot Bank / Unlimited Cash Back Bank Account"". This was also fraudulently opened in my name. I called and reported the fraud to the bank. The bank refused to tell me any details about when the account was opened, if there were any funds in the account, or if any withdrawals occurred.

Today I received another bank card from a third bank ""Green Dot Bank / Walmart Money Card"". I am currently on hold with this bank - which has the same ""thank you for your patience"" voice as the Green Dot Bank I called yesterday.

I feel sick to my stomach. I don't know how to stop additional bank accounts from being opened in my name. I have currently been on hold over 90 minutes waiting for the fraud department. I am so worn out on talking to these banks. I also don't know what the attacker was planning to do with these bank accounts. I guess maybe he had online access and could withdraw the money without the bank card? Or was he planning on raiding my mailbox (since he has my address and all) to get the physical bank card?

Can anyone shed any light on what the attacker is trying to accomplish? Should I expect even more bank accounts in the mail? I am hopeful that these 3 bank accounts corresponded to the 3 of my real bank accounts that were attacked, and maybe there won't be any more. 

Is there anything I can do with this ""Green Dot Bank"" that has allowed an attacker to illegally open 2 accounts in my name?

I want to pay the car off as fast as possible. So besides the normal monthly payment, its probably wise I put an extra $50, right?

So I've tried a couple companies already in my area , to try and get a general idea of closing costs  / total savings when it comes to refinancing from my current 3.8% (or so) loan to try and get down to about 2.75%.

At first, they got back to me when it was concerning doing 20-30 year loans, but after telling them I'm trying to get down to a 10 year loan to save as much in interest in payments (at the cost of paying higher monthly payments), both of those companies seemed to have dropped off the face of the earth.

Are there certain reputable companies out there to seek when refinancing, or do you guys just search Yelp / Google in hopes of finding a good one? I just don't want to have to put in applications with several companies in the opes of finding the best deal.

I'm using a mortgage calculator and have a close idea of where my goal is in terms of refinancing / closing costs/ savings, but once I ask questions like ""Why is it this calculator, using the same figures, shows I should be saving more than what you're telling me I should save?"" question comes up, that seems to be ending the conversation.

I am a 22 year old college student. I initially opened my Roth IRA with Vanguard in September of 2019, and contributed $3000. After a few months with them, I decided to transfer my Roth IRA to M1 Finance, as I didn't enjoy the interface with Vanguard. I thought I liked the M1 Finance interface, as I was using them for my individual brokerage account for a few weeks prior to transferring. Unfortunately, I quickly learned that M1 Finance was not the broker I wanted to hold my Roth IRA with. I was trying to transfer my Roth IRA from M1 to Charles Schwab, but M1 was giving me a big headache and not a clear answer. This eventually lead me to liquidating my account, and transferring the money into my bank. I am now with Charles Schwab and have contributed another $3000 for the 2019 year. From my understanding, since I took out the money from my M1 Finance account, I cannot contribute another $3000 to the 2019 year. Is this correct? And if so, is there anything I can do since I feel like I was mislead at the time with M1 Finance.

t3_gisaoj,Should I refinance my car?,"Hi y’all! My name is Emma and this is my first post here as someone that doesn’t know that much about credit scores and this and that, I would really appreciate some help. Here’s the background to my situation (super long sorry):
September of 2018 I got my first car from a dealer (and thus first car payment). I had pretty crappy credit as I was going through nursing school and supporting myself at the age of 18. No excuse but it led me to my current loan of 60 months with a 22.62% APR owing 10085 on the price of the car. Total cost I owe in the end is 17212.
Flash forward to now and I am much better off financially. My bills are minimal, and I just took a crisis job helping with Covid-19 in NJ. I have payed off quite a bit on the car and only owe 6200 left. I have the ability to completely pay off my car at the end of this month but I am wondering if I should? Or should I refinance? My thought on refinancing would be to get the cost of my car down to around 1500 and then refinance to make my payments lower and then basically just pay monthly until I wanted to payoff my car and own it. I would do this to keep the loan on my credit to extend my credit age. It’s currently at 2 years 10 months and I don’t just wanna close stuff willy-nilly. My only other contributions to my credit score are my student loans and one credit card I pay off monthly. I understand if I refinance I may have to pay more in the end, but if I’m correct about it boosting my score I just look at the extra money as an investment into my financial wealth. Is this silly and I should just buy off my car when I can? Will this help at all??

t3_gis9x6,Financial plans for relocating,"I am 23 and entering my final year of college. After I graduate, I am going to move to California. I’m not sure where, it will depend where I can land a job. I know that location makes a huge difference when it comes to financial planning, but I am sure you all still have some helpful input. 

I will be graduating with a degree in Biology. I am eventually going to Medical School, but I want to take some time off to pay down my student loans and to get my feet on the ground. In the meantime, I hope to get a job doing medical device sales, or something of that nature.

I currently have 40k in student loan debt. I am already working on paying it back while I am still in school so I can get ahead. By the time I graduate, I will probably have paid it down to 30k, maybe even less. (I have a full time job, and I have a side hustle in which the money goes directly to my loans).

I know it may seem irresponsible to move somewhere so expensive while I have such a high amount of debt (I currently live in Arkansas where the cost of living is much lower) but it has been a dream of mine to live in California for as long as I can remember. I want to do it while I’m young and free with few responsibilities.

Of course, I wouldn’t move there until I got a job. But I still need money prior to moving. I would greatly appreciate financial planning advice for this move. My focus is my debt right now, but how much should I be putting aside for next year? 

I’d also just appreciate any of your own experiences or advice!

t3_giogwg,Thinking about VA Streamline/IRRL,"My husband and I have a 30-year VA mortgage with an interest rate of 3.75%. We’re considering refinancing through a VA “Streamline” or IIRL but aren’t sure whether or not it’s worth it because while we aren’t looking to move any time soon, this house isn’t our “forever home.”
 
We called around for quotes and the best we received was from our current lender, who offered a 30-year rate of 2.825% with a monthly savings of $661, which we would immediately then re-apply to our monthly payment as principal, essentially keeping our monthly payment the same, paying off the loan roughly around the same time but slightly earlier, and just reducing the amount of interest paid over the life of the loan by about $184K. We would skip one month’s payment before our new loan goes into effect, then apply that deferred payment amount to our principal, and all we’d be on the hook for at closing would be rolled into the new loan, which is $5,101 and includes closing costs and per diem interest. So we’d break even within the first year.

t3_girvcq,"My dad passed away. No insurance, CC debt and IRS implications. Need advice.","Need to use a throwaway account for this.

My dad passed away over 3 weeks ago. He was self employed, and had no health or life insurance. Hospital bills are pouring in, upwards of $40k (so far.) He left behind about $50k in credit card debt and my mom charged the funeral ($10k) to a card as well. They own a home with $9k left on the mortgage and it’s worth about $180k. My dad worked his entire life, literally up until the day he died; I don’t want his debtors taking the home he worked so hard for. 

We’ve started claims with the credit card companies, still waiting to hear back from them. My mom was an authorized user on all of them.

We have spoken to the hospitals about bill reduction. One of the things they want is either the last tax return, or a letter from the IRS, claiming no taxes filed. Here’s the kicker...

My dad never filed any taxes. Ever. We moved to the US in 1990 from England. 30 years of working under the table. I don’t know how this happened, or how he got away with it. Most likely it’s because he never made much money. Enough to pay the bills, put me through college, and travel to Ireland/England a couple times a year to visit family. His work (house painter) really slowed down over the last few years, thus the massive credit card debt. 

I’m in a little over my head now. My aunt is helping by reaching out to lawyers and accountants. The accountant worries that if we request these non-filer documents, we could be opening a can of worms with the IRS. But he also said the probate process might open them up anyway. 

My mom is super worried she is going to lose the house. We would like to be able to sell it so she has money to pay off the credit cards and have some money to be able to live off of (most likely with me.)

t3_girfov,Am I eligible for unemployment?,"Throwaway b/c personal information. 
My significant other and I were living and working in our college city after we graduated, but we are from the same hometown/city. I in particular missed my family, and we were planning on moving back eventually to be closer to them. Back in March he got a dream job offer in our hometown, which he accepted. So, eventually suddenly became now. I applied for jobs, and within a few weeks I got an offer which I accepted. Due to timing, I had to put in my two weeks at the job I was currently working immediately, and they quickly starting training a new hire to replace me. This hiring process for me was happening at the end of March, and I was supposed to start my new job in mid April (literally finishing at my old job on a Friday and starting the new one on a Monday). Well, COVID happened and a week before my start date they pushed my start date back to June for “protecting our staff etc” reasons, though I suspected it was monetary. I immediately started searching for other jobs in the area, and got another interview lined up with a different company. I had two interviews for two different positions, and they didn’t pan out. So here I am mid-May unemployed and uninsured. I strongly suspect I will be getting a call in the next two weeks informing me that my June start is no longer happening. 

Since I left my old job voluntarily, is there any chance am I eligible for unemployment? I live in Texas for reference. I really thought I would easily be able to find another job, but I clearly underestimated the impact of COVID. I have continued applying for jobs every week over the past few weeks with no luck, and it doesn’t help that I am lacking in experience as I only graduated last May. There are a few reasons I don’t think I can return to my old job 1. They have already hired a replacement for me 2. While my manager and supervisor were very understanding of my leaving, I technically broke a contract by leaving the company, and if I was to show interest in being re-hired I may get blocked by HR, in addition to the possibly of HR realizing that I technically owe said company a couple thousand dollars for leaving in the first place 3.

t3_gikwho,Car dealership wants to change terms of payment after transaction complete,"So I helped my niece purchase a used Audi vehicle from an Audi dealership in Texas, several hundred miles from me (I'm also in Texas). She confirmed with the salesman/dealer BEFORE driving there that they would accept payment from me using my debit card and her trade-in. There is NO financing involved in this transaction. 

She goes there the next day, dealer requested a photo of my ID, which is understandable given that I'm paying via debit card (I called the bank before hand to raise the daily limit on my card to cover the transaction). Dealer takes my debit card info over the phone and I watch my bank account in real time as their charge appears on my screen as ""pending.""  Dealer takes the trade-in, paperwork is signed, niece drives away in her newly acquired Audi. 

Two days later, dealer calls my niece saying they ""accidentally"" ran my debit card as a credit card, and now wants to reverse the charge, and for me to go to the bank and obtain a cashier's check to send to the dealer, or wire the funds to the dealer. Perhaps I'm overly suspicious, but my spidey-sense is tingling that this seems a bit shady/scammish to me. I checked my bank account and the dealer has been paid and the charge is no longer ""pending"" and the funds are out of my account. I tell my niece that this sounds kind of ""off"" to me, and I seriously doubt they would ""accidentally"" put a transaction that large through as a credit instead of a debit, given the percentage a credit card transaction would have been on this transaction.

t3_giqw0j,Will a mortgage lender give me this amount of money for a house?,"Relevant information:

- 25 years old, 85k salary (and increasing), California

- I have a 150k down payment

- Looking to buy a ~700k-750k house 

With my down payment, a house in the 700-750k range is 22% down payment. 

Zillow says houses at these prices with that down payment come down to $3,300-$3,500 a month. After taxes, retirement, etc, my paycheck comes out to about $4,500 a month.

I plan to rent out a room in my house when I move in to help with extra income. Let's say I rent a room in the house to someone for $1,700 a month.

$4,500+$1,700-$3500 leaves me with $2,700 left over from my actual paycheck of $4,500. That would technically mean I pay 40% for housing, a little over the general guideline of 33%, but it makes sense knowing I live in California.

Would a mortgage lender give me the extra $550,000 after my down payment to buy that house knowing I will be renting out a room? Is there a special rule or different type of application I have to fill out for renting?

I know there's another guideline that says not to buy a house over 3x your annual income, but I don't feel like that applies to me since I have a hefty downpayment and I'm willing to rent the house out as well.",personalfinance,mortgage lender give amount money house,relevant information year old salary increasing california payment looking buy house payment house range payment zillow say house price payment come month tax retirement etc paycheck come month plan rent room house move help extra income let say rent room house someone month leaf left actual paycheck would technically mean pay housing little general guideline make sense knowing live california would mortgage lender give extra payment buy house knowing renting room special rule different type application fill renting know another guideline say buy house annual income feel like applies since hefty downpayment willing rent house well,mortgage lender give amount money house relevant information year old salary increasing california payment looking buy house payment house range payment zillow say house price payment come month tax retirement etc paycheck come month plan rent room house move help extra income let say rent room house someone month leaf left actual paycheck would technically mean pay housing little general guideline make sense knowing live california would mortgage lender give extra payment buy house knowing renting room special rule different type application fill renting know another guideline say buy house annual income feel like applies since hefty downpayment willing rent house well

t3_giqk1n,Balance Transfer Card Payment Strategy Before Personal Loan,"I've got 3 balance transfer cards right now, all at high utilization (detailed below). I intend to take out a personal loan in the next few months (August probably) to pay these off, and I was wondering what the best strategy would be for paying these down in the meantime to get the best rate on the personal loan. Credit Karma lists my score as 680 if that matters here, and I have a number of other cards at 0 utilization.

Card 1 - $5,000 balance on $7,500 limit, just ended 0% APR and is now 13.99%  
Card 2 - $3,200 balance on $4,000 limit, 0% APR until August  
Card 3 - $6,200 balance on $8,500 limit 0% APR until August

I currently have roughly $1,500 budgeted per month to put towards paying these down. In terms of credit score and rate on a personal loan, would the best option here be to:  
1 - pay these down ""equally"", trying to reduce utilization on each of them equally  
2 - pay down card 1 as fast as possible and minimums on the others

Or does it matter at all? I recognize that option 1 would result in slightly more interest charged on card 1 for the couple months, but maybe that's offset by an improved interest rate on the other one.

t3_gimg4z,"Parents buy my mortgage, act as new lenders?","Recently, my stepdad proposed replacing our home loan with a loan from them. They said they were planning to liquidate some of their assets and offered to use the cash they got to pay off our mortgage, and then have us treat them as the agency that owns our mortgage.

t3_gipsap,[US] Do I [mid 20's] get an MBA now?,"TLDR: mid 20's; roughly 9.5 years of experience, non traditional career path. 125k salary currently, 375k net worth, Considering UC Davis MBA for 105k - part time. Is it worth it?

Started in accounting/bookkeeping 

Worked for client in Health Technology.  Worked at firm for 5 years, Got offers at 1 large defense contractor, 1 well known unicorn, and 1 large university. 

Wanted something more ethically rewarding so I joined public sector and became an executive within a short period. Do well with it. I'm well liked and do great work but the public sector is unlikely to yield anywhere close to the promotions I've seen in the past. I'm fast paced and don't want to get bored and I like the idea of having the options to go into other fields in the next 2-3 years. I am looking at the next 40 years of my career and thinking about what I could do at this point and without an MBA my options seem limited. I don't want an MPA, but I'm open to other graduate programs in theory, but a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush in this case and I'm already in the program...

I enjoy being in the public sector. The WLB and the pay at this level and at my age are good. I'm free to work on my side businesses (consulting and a real estate development) but they are really more hobbies at this point than serious investments.

Looking at UC Davis MBA - Online with the option of switching to part time. Currently work in public sector. Make 125k with great benefits and low chance of layoff amidst COVID 19.

Didn't take the GMAT, didn't really want to yet but noticed that several schools were waiving the GMAT requirement due to COVID. I figured what the heck, and applied to a few low state schools for the ""check box"" and then UC Davis because I was genuinely interested in a better program where I could keep my job while I did it. I've never had any problems academically and am confident I could do an MBA and work.

I did very well at the tech company I was at as well as some other business side dealings and have roughly 300k saved. I also have around 75k in 401k/retirement funds and my partner (28) has 100k in their savings. We live frugally and certainly don't spend all of our income but buy most of what we want. Partner is finishing first degree in December and will likely get a low starting salary out of school (50-60k) after a short break. Neither of us are looking to FIRE as we enjoy working and if we decide in the future it looks more than likely that we will be fine with doing so. We took all of our money out of the market in late February, narrowly missing the crash but not making any capital gains currently. Likely to go back in the market in equity in a few months and real estate.

I got into UC Davis for their online MBA, it costs 105k! yikes. Meanwhile other schools want applicants to take the traditional MBA again. I frankly don't much want to take the GMAT at this point for a few reasons. At the top of the list, if I took the GMAT and scored well (I have done very well on the practice tests) and got into a M7 program. I still don't think I'd go. 2 years at 125k with 3-&gt;5% raises plus my side business income 25k per year in lost income and 120k for school is a whopping $424k. I went to a low rank school for UG that doesn't impress on my resume.

t3_gij9df,"Currently looking to buy a home, which would reduce monthly expenses by $500. Have enough for 10% down and 1 year of emergency funds. Her job is solid. Mine is very rocky. Thoughts?","We live on Houston. She is a lawyer and I'm in oil and gas. After moving around for the last 10 years, we are pretty much set living here because of her great job.  

Her Salary: 75k
My Salary:100k  

We are looking at a 200k house with 10% down. PMI would be about $40 per month until we reach 20% (this has been verified by lender due to credit, etc.). Overall its well below our means.

Our current rent is $1600 per month, which is the going rate for the area. If we purchased a home, we would be looking at ~1k with taxes and insurance. A saving of $500 per month.

Prices don't fluctuate here like in CA (+/- 300k). And the location we are looking at has no history of flooding and FEMA classifies as low risk.  

The only negative to this situation is my job is rocky. Our monthly expenses are around $3k. We have 40k set aside for emergency (not utilized for house).  

Her job covers all the bills, and I think $500 less in monthly expenses is a plus. I understand homes have additional cost (I've owned 3 before now - we used to move a lot but now settled). However not $500 per month extra. It will also help with taxes. We currently have nothing to write off.

t3_giphog,Cost-Benefits of HSAs and Receipt Reimbursements,"My wife, daughter and I are enrolled in my company's high deductible ($4k family) HSA plan.  We intend to grow our family a bit over the next few years with an obvious range of potential outcomes.  Other than maternity care and trips to the pediatrician, we do not have any regular medical expenses.  Assuming hypothetically, we have 4 kids (all separately) over the next 7 years, we will most likely hit the $4k deductible a minimum of 4 times.  Assuming the other 3 years our medical expenses are &gt;$1k, is an HSA plan still advisable, or would it be better to switch to a regular plan that covers maternity during potential pregnancy years?  Obviously pregnancies can carry over into a new year thereby refreshing the deductible, but the costs generally only start racking up in the third trimester and during labor/delivery.

As an an important caveat, I intend to use my HSA as a retirement vehicle.  I love that it is triple-taxed advantaged and would hate to give it up for a new plan.  At the same time, I want to approach this in the most cost-savy way.

Finally, on a related note, I have a few questions re receipt reimbursement for HSAs:
-Are electronic receipts permissible if they meet the general requirements? (e.g., email receipts)
-Can you combine documents to form one receipt? (e.g., an unpaid bill describing the nature of the service provided combined with a receipt for that bill indicating payment.

t3_gipgl8,Need a second opinion,"I posted this on another sub and got downvoted (not a lot, but enough to doubt myself and need a second opinion). Years ago, my ex and I (both in our mid 20’s at the time) needed to decide on future living arrangements. I lived at home with my parents still (with a full-time job) and my ex (he had a full-time job as well) was being forced to move out of his parents house due to them getting divorced. We made ab 60,000 combined (def not a lot for the area we live in) and I had a large chunk of money inherited from my grandmother saved up (ab 30,000). I proposed the following scenario: I would buy a cheap condo (using my inheritance as the down payment) and then my ex would just move in with me and pay rent (equal to half of the mortgage; approx $500). My ex was angry that I suggested this and said something to the effect of, “no way, that’s not fair! What the hell do I get outta that arrangement?”. I didn’t understand what was unfair ab the suggestion; we’d get to live together, he gets cheaper rent payments, plus I’d at least be investing my money into property without having to worry ab any mess if we broke up (he’d get to walk anyway at anytime if things went sour). The person who commented and disagreed with me kept saying that if my ex was paying towards the mortgage, then they have equity in the property but I don’t understand that.... wouldn’t it be the same as any other landlord/renter agreement?

t3_gi7k6z,You can add cash to your online only bank account by using the BlueBird prepaid card and there are no fees.,"I've noticed people occasionally asking how to add cash to online bank accounts when they don't have a brick and mortar bank to deposit cash for a transfer.  Also some online banks require you to link another bank account when you sign up just to make the first deposit. 

I just opened an Ally online bank account and I linked it to my BlueBird prepaid card. BlueBird is one of the best prepaid cards because it has almost no fees. It has no monthly fees and no fees to add cash at a Walmart. So that's how I put cash into my Ally account. I go to Walmart, deposit cash (no fee) onto my BB card and then just transfer the cash to my Ally Bank account. It's easy and cost nothing.

Note 1: The first time you'll need to link your accounts and this does take a few days for the banks to verify each other. First you use your online bank site to link to BB with the routing and bank numbers. 

Linking the other way is a little tricky because BB doesn't offer the option on its app. You have to use the regular BB online or mobile site and find the right links. 

First go to the BlueBird regular *online site* (not the app). 

When you get to the BB site click the three dashes on the top right corner. Then click ""settings"" and then  ""withdraw funds"" and then ""transfer to bank."" 

Note 2: It does take 2-5 days for money transfers after the initial set up.

Note 3: My friend used the same method to open a Radius online bank account which required a $100 deposit to sign up.

t3_giop20,Debating on where to move this summer. Torn between two locations/possibilities.,"What the title says. 

I currently have 2 options in mind. I could move within 20mins of work (where the cheapest nice apartments close are). Which would cost at minimum 600/month and close to 200/300 utilities. It would be 20mins from work and cut down on my gas somewhat. I'd say w that option, about 100/month in gas (I figured this from staying w a friend for a short while who lives near where I'd b moving). 

Or I could stay in the town I'm in, which is a small town. The same sized apartment would cost about 450/month and closer to 200/month in utilities. 35/40 minute drive from work. I spend about 160/month in gas. 

I'm just trying to think in the long run what would be better for me? It's only a 15 minute/60$ a month gas difference. But a 250$/month cash difference. 

And while part of me would love to be closer to work and friends, part of me would also prefer to have that money to save. I've already been driving the distance daily for almost 5 years to work and to see friends (vice versa). But I'm considering in the long run. 

I've also considered a middle third option of staying in my town for 1-2 years until my vehicle is paid off then moving closer once I have that extra change in my pocket. I'm also considering my privacy. I know being in my hometown would be nice because I'd be near some family in case of emergency, but on the other hand, that also means the possibility of more intrusions from said family. 

So, in looking for advice, what would anyone recommend? Any advice or input is greatly appreciated!

t3_giokjd,Recent college graduate seeking investment advice,"I graduated college two years ago and am on track to finish paying off my student loans next month. In doing so, I will free up a lot of money in my budget to invest.

Until the last couple of weeks, I have been investing investing up to my employer match of 6%. I have since changed this to 10% as I am trying to invest more aggressively. Out of the Fidelity funds available for me to select, I have chosen the SP 500 Index PL CL C. As I only just turned 24, I am not really interested in bonds and am willing to be aggressive and take on a bit of risk.

However, I have also opened up a Roth IRA where I contribute about an additional 5% of my earnings. It seems a bit trickier to select funds as there are a lot more to choose from. I would also like to be aggressive so I've been looking at investing in something like FNILX, which has an expense ratio of 0, or QQQ, which seems to be a known and and reputable fund.

I know that I said that I want to be aggressive and avoid bonds, but I'm also wondering if investing in something like QQQ or FNILX is redundant given my 401k fund.

Should I incorporate more international funds to compliment what I already have?

t3_gio4el,Credit Score Consequences?,"My wife has her own personal card that she uses for random purchases (it's a MC, and sometimes our VISA isn't accepted somewhere.) She had a $100 charge on in February that she forgot about - baby, quarantine, pandemic, etc. - and I was starting to look at our options for mortgage renewal later this summer (August) this weekend. I encouraged her to try out one of the free credit report websites (e.g. Borrowell) which is where we discovered this outstanding charge and its fairly **significant** impact on her credit score. She paid the $100 off immediately and contacted the credit card company, where they explained the account was now closed, but the new payment information would be shared with credit agencies after the 21st of May.

My question:  


1. How quickly will her credit score increase after dealing with this? There are no other issues of any kind on her report. We have a mortgage we have been paying at an accelerated rate over the the past five years, including extra payments and out credit utilization rate is very low.
2. We noticed our mortgage is not listed on either of our credit reports. Is this a limitation of a free credit report? Would this information be included on a hard inquiry made by a financial institution when it comes to renewing our mortgage, thereby giving a more accurate overview of her score (e.g. a higher one?)

Wishing this had been noticed earlier, and not four months old from when our current mortgage matures and we need to renew, but also hoping this is enough time to sort this out. Our concern is also that missed payments over this period of time are simply reported the same way, no matter how small the amount is (again, $100) and that it was an oversight.

t3_gintnl,Is there much of a downside to borrow $5k from my 401k at 4.75% to pay down a 10% auto loan?,"As of next month, I'll have about $7k on 0% APR credit cards until at least July 2021, all other credit paid off, and a refinanced mortgage with a $300/mo payment shaved off.

After all expenses, I'll have $2,000 available per month--this is factoring in extraneous expenses on average, so $2k+. No other debt will be left; I'll be paying off the last of my personal loan and all other credit cards are paid off in full every statement cycle (most bills go on credit).

This is the first time I'll be basically debt free.

t3_ginsis,"Should I choose 401k, IRA, or backdoor Roth IRA?","Yes I've read the sidebar, and a lot on the subject, but there doesn't seem to be a definitive best answer for my situation. I'm hoping I can give some of the smarter people here some personal details so that I can gather more catered advice.

details:

My employer offers a non-matched 401k which I've been using because it's easy. Wife and I make enough where we can't do a Roth IRA without using the backdoor method, and also make enough so that IRA contributions don't lower our taxes (I think that's how it works?). In case it matters, she has a great 50% matched 401k which she fills up every year, and I should retire with a great employer sponsored pension and health insurance from my union, so these retirement savings under discussion are more supplemental than primary.

We live in a HCOL area so we make a lot and spend a lot. For what it's worth, I grew up modestly and can see myself retiring that way. But it's good to have options

So far Ive learned the benefits of the 401k for my situation are that it lowers my taxable income, and the detriments are that it's 1) the most restrictive to access, and 2) doesn't have many investment options (offers goal-date funds with fidelity).

t3_gib850,Choosing between Traditional/Roth 401k,"I know there are multiple posts about this and an entry in the Wiki, and I've read them, but I'm still not sure what the best option is. Consequently, I've created this throwaway -- in order to be quite specific about my financial details -- in hopes of getting a more clear answer.

I make $120,000/yr pre-tax, and my employer contributes 10% of my annual salary to a traditional 401k on my behalf each year. I currently max my yearly contribution limits into a Roth 401k (separate from my employer contributions, which as I understand, do not count toward my limits).

My wife makes about $40,000/yr pre-tax as a public school teacher. She thus contributes to a fixed-benefits pension and additionally contributes $12,000/yr into a 457(b). 

We both max our yearly Roth IRA contributions ($6000 each).

We are thus currently at the very high end of the 22% tax bracket, and likely to break into the low end of the 24% tax bracket in the next few years, and so the extra AGI adjustment from deducting retirement investments is unlikely to do too much there. 

Until now, I have been operating under the assumption that it's not a bad idea to invest into a Roth 401k until I'm in my 40s, at which point I thought I might switch, but doing some research more recently, I've found that it's often recommended to go for a traditional 401k when you're in a higher income tax bracket.

Anyway, to the question!

I sent in my 2018-19 federal tax return completely normal, received back a note asking for more information, which I provided. A few months later I still hadn't received my return. I kind of just kept assuming it would arrive eventually. This year doing my 2019-20 tax return I realized I never got my federal return back! I'm now realizing that I should have pursued this a lot sooner. When I try to go to the IRS I can't get any answers because all their websites keep directing me to 2019-20 tax questions and if I call them I can't get a human to talk to!

t3_ginga8,Refi or Refi Cash Out,"Hi everyone.  I was again looking for some advice from those interested/knowledgeable on the mortgage topic.

I currently have a 30 year/4% loan (about 5 years in).  Bought the home for 300k and now its worth about 450k.  I owe 190k currently, and I have a HELOC opened for 60k that I have not accessed.  

I am looking into refinancing and found the lowest currently to be a 3.125%/15 year.  If it was not for my HELOC, I would be able to get a 3.0%.  Also, it seems that refi-cashouts are currently not available due to COVID.

Do you all think it would be wise to:

1) Take the 15 year refi now and keep the HELOC?
2) Keep the 30 year mortgage and wait for better 15 year rates/until refi-cash outs are available, whenever that is?
3) Keep the 30 year and pay it down aggressively like a 15 year?

t3_gincht,keep contributing only to 401k or diversify monthly retirement contributions?,"Hi PF! Long-time lurker, first-time poster.

I'm trying to figure out the best place to contribute the money I set aside for retirement each month. (Apologies if this is an easy q, but I haven't been able to find an answer using the PF wiki.)

For context: I'm 30, I'm a school social worker, and I'm making 75k (will go up to 80 in August when my new contract begins). I plan to stay at this job for a while, but I know that this salary is on the higher end for my profession, and I don't anticipate earning much more than 100k/year in the future. Right now, I contribute 11% to my 401k (employer matches 1%). I have a traditional IRA that I opened years ago with Fidelity with several thousand dollars in it, and just rolled over a Roth IRA that my parents had opened for me years ago to Fidelity, also with several thousand dollars.

My question: where should I be putting my retirement savings? Right now, I'm only actively contributing to my 401k. Does it make sense for me to contribute money more equally between the 401k, Roth, and traditional IRA? How would you advise me to contribute it, given that 401k is taken out pre-tax, but there are advantages at the time of withdrawal with IRAs?

Thanks in advance!

t3_gina4s,I Have A New Job Offer,"Hi, everyone. I am going for an interview tomorrow! I do currently have a job. However, it is in an entry level position and pays minimum wage ($13 per hour) in a high cost of living area. I am college-edicated, have earned an important certification since I began working at my current job fourteen months ago and I am actively pursuing another highly regarded industry certification.

I have my hands in a little of everything, given that the company is just my boss and me (a small LLC). But most of my duties are administrative. Billing, invoicing, filing, etc. But I also create documents for clients, collect data, onboard them, send them forms they need, sit in on meetings and record the minutes, troubleshoot technology issues, help to ensure compliance, etc. Needless to say, my knowledge in the field is rapidly growing. 

I am already grossly underpaid, but when I was hired I really needed the money, so I took what I could get (I also came from a completely different industry and thus had no experience a year ago). 

The new job says starting salary is $40,000-45,000, equivalent to $19.23 to $21.63 per hour. But the person I've been in contact with says I will likely start closer to the $15-16 per hour range and be rapidly promoted to closer to $20 after an as yet undetermined probationary period, although an official offer has not been made. The average salary for an administrative assistant in my area ranges from about $39,000-$48,000. My title at the new company would be something like Client Services Administrator. I feel that with my additional knowledge above and beyond the basics of office administration, I should be paid more.

My question is this: Given the fact that I am only making $13 per hour currently, how hard should I negotiate for a higher salary right off the bat? Should I take the likely initial $15-16 per hour and be happy when I get $19 or $20 per hour in a few months? Or should I go in and tell them the average salary of administrative assistants in the area and hope they at least meet that upfront? I don't think I'd be greedy asking for $19.25 per hour ($40,000) upfront, but I also don't want to turn them off.

t3_gin145,Will paying off a section of my student loan harm my credit score?,"Edit: I've decided to hold on to my extra cash and use it towards buying a car in the next few months. After I've bought the car I won't have any hesitations about paying off loans impacting my credit score because it will be a while until the next time I need an inquiry. 

Original post:

My student loan is divided into 4 sections. My regular monthly payment gets divided up and sent to each loan group based on the minimum monthly payment. Because of the current student loan forbearance I'm not making monthly payments. Instead of continuing to send the money to be evenly divided as usual, I thought this would be a good time to direct all my extra money to totally pay off the loan group with the highest interest and lowest dollar amount.

I was surprised earlier this year when I paid off my car loan and my credit score fell from 740 to 715. I figured out it was because one of the aspects of the credit score is ""Total Accounts"" and more open accounts is better. The score recovered since then and the only thing harming me is the short length of credit (5 years).

I now have 4 installment loans (student) and 1 revolving (credit card) account. Even though I am able to pay off one of the installment loans I am worried about the effect that having one fewer open account will have on my score. I think that the benefit of avoiding additional interest outweighs the potential negative impact to the score but I could be wrong.

Am I overthinking this?

t3_gimu2b,Two accounts charged off in 2017. Want to fix my credit (as best I can) before I move back to US next year.,"So, as an early-twenty-something, I obviously screwed my financial situation badly. I was paying regularly on my accounts, then I moved overseas and wasn't making enough money in AUD to pay my accounts back in the US, so I just let them pile up. They were both charged off in late 2017, but because I was overseas, I never had to face any sort of collections notice or harassment or anything, and now obviously my credit is in tatters. I want to fix that.  


I've ordered my credit reports from the bureaus, and they all say that these two accounts are charged-off. Full disclosure: one from Barclays Bank Delaware and the other from Discover Financial Services. Only the Barclays Bank account has been closed though. I know where that debt has been sent, but that collections agency doesn't appear on my credit report. If I pay the debt collector, do they then let Barclays know that I've paid the account? I'm confused on how that gets resolved. Also, I'm somewhat familiar with the concept of zombie debt.

t3_gimrhg,"I'm a complete novice and have ~10k to invest, what should I do?","Hi! I'm a long time lurker, first time poster, and I could use some guidance. 

It feels a bit surreal to say it, but due to the nature of my work, and my wife's work, our income has not been affected by the coronavirus pandemic and our expenses have gone down quite a bit. 

As a result, for the first time in my life I find myself with some free cash on hand that I don't have any immediate need for, no high-interest debt that needs paying off, and nothing in particular I need to buy. 

I work in the financial services sector so although this is the first occasion I've had to put my OWN money in the market, I've got a lot of background and exposure to the mechanisms by which it operates 

I've watched a lot of occasions come and go where the market dropped precipitously due to temporary circumstances where a complete or mostly complete recovery in the medium (12-18 months) was almost certain. I'm pretty sure that this is another one of those times and I'm likewise pretty certain that I can get a better return on the $10k or so that I have on hand by putting in the market right now rather than just paying against my 4% mortgage, which is the only significant debt I'm carrying. 

All of that said, where do I start? Day Trading on the futures market is within my means, but I'm not sure if that's the best line of attack. I'm pretty sure I could get at least a 10% to 20% return just by buying the right funds or stocks, but I'm not sure what the right entry point for that is either.

I originally thought that it was due to an influx of calls due to Covid-19 but I have tried at numerous times throughout the day for the last 2 weeks so I'm starting to think that either their system is down or they're not accepting any phones calls and maybe they've laid off a lot of their employees?

t3_gimadq,I need help making better financial decisions and choies.,"Hello,

I am in a high paying job but I will leave it in a few months. It is a contracting job overseas and I want to go back to the United States.

**My Savings:**

3k - HYSA

4k - Taxable Brokerage

13k - ROTH IRA

9k - 401k

8k - 401k 

3k - Checking account

&amp;#x200B;

**Monthly paycheck: 13503.16**

Taxes - 4607.36

Deduction - 188.81

401k - 2025.5

Net income - 6682.84

&amp;#x200B;

**Monthly spending**

2400 Mortgage

600 bills 

3000 HYSA

682 remainder (prob more hysa)

&amp;#x200B;

Notes:

I have virtually no savings right now because I just bought a house.

329,000 k remainder, 4.5% APR. I will refinance as soon as I get an opportunity upon my return.

No doubt, I am in a very fortunate position. However, I want to go home and enjoy my life in the United States. I want to settle down and start a family.

The problem is, I am not sure what I want to do when I go home. My current job overseas is a defense contract and my job isn't really applicable in the states. 

I do have a bachelor's degree from a top school but it is in a science field I no longer want to puruse.

I have a job offer from a three letter agency but it is in the East Coast. I bought my house in the West Coast.

I have not filed my 2019 taxes yet. I have extended until October. The reason being is that I will be eligible for the FEIE in July 15th. I think I'll get a good chunk back.

I'm trying to hold on to December 2020. This way, i can do FEIE for 2020 and get a large chunk back. it is about 20k I get in tax returns if I stay here the whole time. Maybe a lil less because CA. 

The reason I bought my house is because I found out my immediate family (mom and sibling) were next to homeless. As an exchange, they take care of my house while my sibling is finishing college and I am doing whatever I want overseas.

Once my sibling graduates college, I will let them build savings for a year and then will have them leave.

My mom, she can come or go. I think she wants to leave. I don't mind, there are plenty of rooms in the home.

I  have a few large purchases that I need to save up for

\- Refinancing my house. 

\- A car. I think I am going to get a cheap car under 10k? A used Honda or something.

&amp;#x200B;

**My questons**

1) Should I maintain my 401k contribution rate at this economical climate? My fundamentals says yes because DCA, time in the market blah blah

2) My 401k is a traditional because my tax bracket is pretty high especially in California. After I quit here, I was going to take a year off and then just convert my trad 401k to my roth IRA. (allowed?)

I think this is a good idea because I will get a tax break for 2020 and can get money into my ROTH while my taxable income is low during 2021.

3) I am going to take a few months off. To do some soul searching on what I want to do.Therefore, I need to save up for a year of savings. 3000 x 12 = 36,000 in my HYSA seem reasonable?

4) Off topic quetsion, does anyone have any recommendations of career advice? I don't really want to work in Defense anymore. Nor do I want to work in biochem (degree).

t3_gim984,"Bad credit but good job, financing a car for the first time","Hello everyone! I know that PF hates financing new cars from what I’ve read but most of the horror stories seem to be people that are already struggling before getting into a car loan. 

Anyway about me I am in my late 20’s and have always just paid in full in cash for all of my cars. They all inevitably break down after a few years and I repeat this cycle. The current car I was in got t-boned and is still drivable but it has just gotten away from me. Check engine light on, brake light on, side mirror destroyed, registration out etc. I’ve avoided repairing these things (all recent things) because I’ve been planning on moving on to a new car soon anyway. I work in management for a large medical company and just got a big promotion and have fantastic job security. The only downside is I’ve not done much throughout my life to improve my credit and have had a few things zap the life out of my credit score until it settled at 568 which is where it’s at now. 

I’m at a point where instead of buying beaters to get through the life I want to get a reliable, new car that I will have for quite some time and gets great gas mileage for my commute and that will also allow me to help build my credit in conjunction with secured credit card, etc. 

I have started the process at a Toyota dealership with a 2019 Corolla that only has 10k miles on it. They’re selling it for $13,990 which is below market for it. At first they were estimating my terms to be 5k down with a payment of $286/month over the dreaded 72 months. After leaving last night I played around their website and looked at what if I bought the car online from them and it came to 4k down and $281/month. 

From what I’ve been told by friends and family I should go in there and tell them I have 4k to put down and that I could do a monthly rate of 260 instead of 286 and tell them if they can match that then I would buy. 

Now I know my interest rate is going to be astronomical and easily 20%+ which adds an insane amount of money paid out in interest over the 72 months. I figured that I have another 6k in bonuses arriving next month and was planning on using another 2k of that to pay on the principle and to repeat that next year when my bonuses come in as well. I also plan on 6 months down the line attempting to refinance with my credit union that I’ve been at for 5 years (they denied my application for initial financing) to work on getting the interest rate down lower.",personalfinance,bad credit good job financing car first time,hello everyone know hate financing new car read horror story seem people already struggling getting car loan anyway late always paid full cash car inevitably break year repeat cycle current car got boned still drivable gotten away check engine light brake light side mirror destroyed registration etc avoided repairing thing recent thing planning moving new car soon anyway work management large medical company got big promotion fantastic job security downside done much throughout life improve credit thing zap life credit score settled point instead buying beater get life want get reliable new car quite time get great gas mileage commute also allow help build credit conjunction secured credit card etc started process toyota dealership corolla mile selling market first estimating term payment month dreaded month leaving last night played around website looked bought car online came month told friend family tell put could monthly rate instead tell match would buy know interest rate going astronomical easily add insane amount money paid interest month figured another bonus arriving next month planning using another pay principle repeat next year bonus come well also plan month line attempting refinance credit union year denied application initial financing work getting interest rate lower,bad credit good job financing car first time  everyone know hate financing new car read horror story seem people already struggling getting car loan anyway late always paid full cash car inevitably break year repeat cycle current car got boned still drivable gotten away check engine light brake light side mirror destroyed registration etc avoided repairing thing recent thing planning moving new car soon anyway work management large medical company got big promotion fantastic job security downside done much throughout life improve credit thing zap life credit score settled point instead buying beater get life want get reliable new car quite time get great gas mileage commute also allow help build credit conjunction secured credit card etc started process toyota dealership corolla mile selling market first estimating term payment month dreaded month leaving last night played around website looked bought car online came month told friend family tell put could monthly rate instead tell match would buy know interest rate going astronomical easily add insane amount money paid interest month figured another bonus arriving next month planning using another pay principle repeat next year bonus come well also plan month line attempting refinance credit union year denied application initial financing work getting interest rate lower

t3_gim1ct,Advice on getting out of debt/loan consolidation,"So my financial situation has been messed up since I was like 20, due to stupidly opening a bunch of credit cards and maxing them out. I'm now almost 30, and have about $6500 left to pay. I, like many others right now, am struggling with my bills due to corona. I am still able to work part time, only about 10-15 hours max, and I'm basically only pulling in about $500 a month right now. I applied for unemployment ages ago, actually back in January before corona came along, and I have yet to see $1 from it. My case is a mess, and I've been trying to contact them to fix things, but haven't been able to get through, so I'm waiting on an email response, which could take up to a month or more.

My main problem is the credit cards I do still have open are collecting a ridiculous amount of interest that is making it harder and harder to make the payments. I've been trying for awhile now to get a personal loan just so I can pay them all off and only have to worry about that one monthly payment. But I haven't been able to get approved because my credit score is 632. I'm really not sure what else to do at this point.

t3_gim0ku,Capital One 360 Savings vs Ally Savings Account? Which one is best for me?,"Hi! I am a 20 yo college student looking to start organizing my finances as I am starting to realize the value of having a long-term plan. So for my case, I look for a few things when it comes to owning a savings account. I've been with Wells Fargo for years now, but their interest rates for their savings are terrible, so i decided to open an online savings account. This led me to choose between capital one and ally, but i constantly hear more about ally being better than capital one. The things I look for in a savings account is

1.Being able to create and categorize different types of savings accounts for different goals (buying a house, emergency funds, a gaming pc)

2.Stability and security in where I save money in (FDIC insured).

3.Great customer service and user-friendly app to keep track of finances.

4.Great long-term interest rates.

I currently opened a captial one savings account, and I noticed how it currently sits at 1.50% whereas Ally is going down at 1.25% which concerns me. Overall I'm not sure how good capital one is, and I seem to not come across any issues with capital one at the moment, but in the long-run, I want to be financially stable and wealthy.

t3_giekho,Target-Date Fund Question: Should Gross Expense Ratio play a role in which Target Fund I choose? Will it matter at this point in time? (I'm 25),"Forgive me if this is an ignorant question, but how much of a difference will a higher expense ratio make when I first start investing in a target-date fund? 

For background: I'm 25 and just set up a Roth IRA for the first time through Charles Schwab. I plan on contributing the full $6,000 per tax year for the foreseeable future. I am most interested in target-date funds as I have no knowledge or experience in investing on my own. 

In looking at the varying target funds they offer, I was planning on selecting the Schwab Target 2060 fund as this is what I had done with my 401k since graduating from undergrad. However, the Gross Expense Ratio listed for the 2055 and 2060 target funds was pretty significant (0.86 for 2055 and 1.41 for 2060). Is this variance normal? If so, does this make a significant difference in the long term or will these expense ratios net out over time as more target-date funds are created later?

t3_gicplw,"Defaulting on unsecured debt, trying to navigate tax owed, not sure of next steps.","Hello.  I've definitely been stumbling a bit financially the past few years and things came to a head this year.  I have about 50K in unsecured debt across credit cards/personal loans (all of which I have stopped paying the past few months).  Another 30k remaining on student loans (which I currently have deferred).  High unsecured debt is from a failed side business venture I had tried to keep going long after I should have let it die.  

I stopped paying because IRS told me I owed a large amount to them from 2018, and I'm currently trying to work things out with them.  

I currently make 75K in salary and get stock options, bonus, and other stock incentive payments.  My trouble with the IRS comes from all the stock income and my initial ignorance on how to handle the taxes on that properly.   I'm told I make too much money to declare full bankruptcy.  

I'm early 30's, I live in Boston, and partially support my partner as well.  We live pretty modestly, as much as one can for living in the Boston area.  Rent is still super high even with an old dilapidated apartment.  No family in the area, and they don't have money to spare anyway.  

I've been able to start saving a lot of money since I stopped paying the CCs/loan and put the student loans into deferment, I have about 15k of cash on hand, and could get another 50K or so if I cashed in a large chunk of my current stock holdings (80K minus what I would need to hold onto for taxes).  My hope is the IRS will accept a low monthly payment for what I owe them.  

&amp;#x200B;

What I want to know is what are my real options.  There is so much predatory ""help"" out there for people in debt, some of which I've already fallen prey to.  

I plan on getting my student loan payments back on track and getting squared away with the IRS.  Do I try to negotiate the unsecured debt in default?  Since it's unsecured, do I just write it off and basically lose any semblance of credit for another decade and deal with the annoyance of collections?  What are things I need to be concerned about from a position like this?  Garnished wages, jail time?  I feel like I can move forward successfully from here - it just seems like all the roads are so foggy and I'm all turned about.

t3_gilqyk,I need some advice because I don't know what would make the most sense financially to move forward,"I don't know how to proceed in life right now, I'm renting an apartment with a roomate, lease is up in September but she is open to renewing with me. My fiance lives in Western Canada, I live in Eastern USA. He visits me from Sept- Feb I try to visit him for a week in spring and a month or two in the summer. I have several options but none of them seem like the clear choice.
I could 
A. Stay where I am, continue on as we are for another year, when he's here he is not making much money, rent increases for me, he is willing to pay for his share of the cost but it makes me uncomfortable and I'd like to pay for the rent myself, I am losing 800 dollars in income come September, and where I am currently I'm on academic suspension at the school so I would have to get that resolved and if it isn't resolved then I waste another year of my limited free tuition and could possibly forfeit the tuition all together, I would then have to work full time and go to school full time. My mental health is not the best, I am planning on seeing a therapist about it but I've been on and off in therapy all my life. When I'm in a bad state mentally I can't leave the house to do anything. I've tried online school and that doesn't work for me when I'm depressed and barely works when I'm not. I do best in a normal class setting. 

B. We live in a van, fiance is slightly uncomfortable with this prefers to live somewhere with a shower and laundry. I like the fact that there's so much freedom to travel and to move where I can get a job that works well with my mental health, I can also start going to a school that doesn't have me on academic suspension, cost of living would be lowered so the loss of 800 a month isn't that big of a blow. Also we would be able to be together more

C. He buys a house in the US. My fear with this is that if things don't work out with school or a job I'm once again stuck. 

D. I rent an apartment in another part of the state that's cheaper and near a school that will accept me.

t3_gill4x,Should I take a penalty-free loan from my 401k for home improvement?,"I've been fortunate to not be affected financially affected by the coronavirus too much. I work for an essential business, on salary, and it's very unlikely anything will affect my job status at my current company. My wife is currently finishing her masters, and will begin as a teacher in the Fall. I'm 27, married, and we own our home. We have about $10k in savings and $30k in a 401k. We have 2 credit cards w/ total of $15k limit, and we don't carry a balance. One card is 0% APR for 9 more months, and I can transfer some of the credit limit from the other card to this one if desired.

I purchased the home back in January 2018, and it was a new home that had no landscaping done to the backyard. I've kinda slacked off from getting it done since then, but being recently married has now made me want to have our backyard landscaped. I estimate that my plans for the backyard will cost about $15k. I also believe that this pandemic will allow for there to be great discounts on projects such as this.

With the recent US stimulus package, it enables me to loan from my 401k penalty-free. Would it be a reasonable decision to pull $10k from the 401k to fund my home improvement project? I understand that pulling from it now may make me miss out when the economy begins coming back. But I also don't foresee the economy coming back quickly, and believe most of the loan could be repaid prior to the stock market rebounding.

Thanks in advance!

**Edit**: Thank you for all of the replies. From the responses, it seems like this is not the best way to go about it. I initially figured that getting \~20% savings on the project from doing it during the pandemic would offset the earnings I would've received if I don't pull from the 401k. 

Sounds like my best bet would be to either 1) save and complete the project later, 2) pay in installments, or 3) look into other loan options, such as a home equity line of credit (HELOC)",personalfinance,take penalty free loan home improvement,fortunate affected financially affected coronavirus much work essential business salary unlikely anything affect job status current company wife currently finishing master begin teacher fall married home saving credit card total limit carry balance one card apr month transfer credit limit card one desired purchased home back january new home landscaping done backyard kinda slacked getting done since recently married made want backyard landscaped estimate plan backyard cost also believe pandemic allow great discount project recent stimulus package enables loan penalty free would reasonable decision pull fund home improvement project understand pulling may make miss economy begin coming back also foresee economy coming back quickly believe loan could repaid prior stock market rebounding thanks advance edit thank reply response seems like best way initially figured getting saving project pandemic would offset earnings would received pull sound like best bet would either save complete project later pay installment look loan option home equity line credit heloc,take penalty free loan home improvement fortunate affected financially affected coronavirus much work essential business salary unlikely anything affect job status current company wife currently finishing master begin teacher fall married home saving credit card total limit carry balance one card apr month transfer credit limit card one desired purchased home back january new home landscaping done backyard kinda slacked getting done since recently married made want backyard landscaped estimate plan backyard cost also believe pandemic allow great discount project recent stimulus package enables loan penalty free would reasonable decision pull fund home improvement project understand pulling may make miss economy begin coming back also foresee economy coming back quickly believe loan could repaid prior stock market rebounding thanks advance edit thank reply response seems like best way initially figured getting saving project pandemic would offset earnings would received pull sound like best bet would either save complete project later pay installment look loan option home equity line credit heloc

t3_giljzr,Are auto loans ever worth it? (CAN),"As the title states, I (22F) am wondering if a car loan is ever worth it. I have looked at the PF Vehicles Wiki and will continue to go through those resources, but want some personal feedback as well.

Some background:
- I am looking at upgrading to a larger vehicle (SUV)
- I have decent but minimal credit as I typically prefer to pay for things upfront. I bought my last vehicle with cash, pay my auto insurance yearly rather than monthly, and paid for my university tuition in full each year. 
- I have a credit card but only really use it when necessary (i.e. booking something online). 
- I have very minimal monthly bills as I am living at home while going to school. I have pretty robust savings and I currently work full time, but I plan on going to grad school in fall 2021. My graduate studies will most likely be fully funded but will not allow time for me to work (at most I will be able to work part-time).

Pros to financing/getting a loan:
- Build up my credit
- Less money upfront
- Could likely get a nicer vehicle 

Cons:
- Owe monthly
- Vehicles depreciate fast
- Will be difficult to find a co-signer since nobody in my life has very good credit

Any advice about auto loans or purchasing a vehicle is welcome! Thank you!

t3_gie21a,401(K) Setup Advice,"Hi Everyone,

I would like some advice on what to do when setting up my 401(k). My employer matches up to 6% so I was planning on putting in 6% myself to get the maximum match, currently this would be ~$550/month total including their match. I would assume this is the right move? I'm 26 years old.


What I'm wondering about the most is what asset allocation model / investment options to choose. Below is a link to what I believe are the pages relevant to what I'm asking about. 


Would it be wise to go with the ""Maximum Growth Model"" for a while considering my age and slowly move towards more conservative investment options? Should I go with the ""Managed Account"" or handle it all myself and just match the percentages to the maximum growth model when picking my investment options to avoid the managed account fees? It seems like it would be fairly easy? This is all done online now, the papers I have are not how we sign up anymore.

t3_gigv5b,Free rent - large student loans- 6 figure salary/savings.,"Hello everybody. I’m a 27 y/o M in the medical field. I traveled for 2 years after graduate school and my GF of 4 years wanted me to come back home. 

I wanted to live in my hometown of Nashville and she wanted to live in her hometown of Memphis, so we compromised and moved to Memphis. 

Her parents have a large 5 bedroom home so I moved in with them. They’re both elderly so my GF and myself clean, cook, etc for them and we get to live rent free. But it’s time to get our own place and do something with my money. 

Assets:
- 105,000k Income. Approx take home a month 6500

- 90,000k in savings. All in a money market with Regions. I was told this would return at 1.8% but that was a flat lie.

Liabilities:
- 70k Student Loans. The only reason I haven’t paid them off is because I’m terrified of paying 70k for loan forgiveness to pass. 

-7k Truck Note (500/month payment)

- 130 monthly insurance 



A financial advisor from Regions is recommending putting 50k into “Buffer Notes” and leaving it for 5 years. Leave 40k in the Money Market. Also says to start an IRA and 401k (my company doesn’t match, why I don’t have one). I cannot find anything about Buffer notes on here. 

And In regards to housing, my GF and I plan on moving to Middle Tennessee in 2-3 years. She wants to flip a house and I want to rent an apartment. 

So.. 

1. What’s a buffer note? Does the advisors suggestions sound good?

2. Do I just rent? Buy and flip? Wait a couple months for a foreclosure?

3. Should I just bite the bullet and pay off the Loans or do y’all think there’s any forgiveness coming in the future?",personalfinance,free rent large student loan figure salary saving,hello everybody medical field traveled year graduate school year wanted come back home wanted live hometown nashville wanted live hometown memphis compromised moved memphis parent large bedroom home moved elderly clean cook etc get live rent free time get place something money asset income approx take home month saving money market region told would return flat lie liability student loan reason paid terrified paying loan forgiveness pas truck note month payment monthly insurance financial advisor region recommending putting buffer note leaving year leave money market also say start ira company match one cannot find anything buffer note regard housing plan moving middle tennessee year want flip house want rent apartment buffer note advisor suggestion sound good rent buy flip wait couple month foreclosure bite bullet pay loan think forgiveness coming future,free rent large student loan figure salary saving  everybody medical field traveled year graduate school year wanted come back home wanted live hometown nashville wanted live hometown memphis compromised moved memphis parent large bedroom home moved elderly clean cook etc get live rent free time get place something money asset income approx take home month saving money market region told would return flat lie liability student loan reason paid terrified paying loan forgiveness pas truck note month payment monthly insurance financial advisor region recommending putting buffer note leaving year leave money market also say start ira company match one cannot find anything buffer note regard housing plan moving middle tennessee year want flip house want rent apartment buffer note advisor suggestion sound good rent buy flip wait couple month foreclosure bite bullet pay loan think forgiveness coming future

t3_gil8qw,My company borrowed my PTO from next year...,"... to pay for a week of the shutdown before we were laid off. I had plans for this PTO. I had prepared for unemployment via E fund and a few other things

I told my boss I didn't want to use the PTO and wanted to save it. So he did. Payroll decided to give a separate deposit of the PTO. This happened a 2nd week as well. 

I was told I can trade work days to buy them back, but here is my problem: taxes. 

I'm single and make around 100k. 

I was taxed on the unwanted use. 

I'm pretty sure I'll be taxed on the days I use to buy this back. 

I'll be taxed on when I use it as I had planned. 

My tax rate is around 24%.

That's a lot of money I'm on the hook for that I didn't want.  

What can I do? 

I'm pretty sure it'll even out at tax time but I'm pretty pissed about this. I live like I'm still making $10/hr, I didn't need their management of my finances. I apparently wasn't even given an option.

I just remembered that I have a spare checking account with a few hundred dollars on it that I don't use regularly.

I've been looking for jobs since, but I haven't found much success.

My employer doesn't match at all the first year of employment, matches up to 7.5% the second year of employment, and in full the 3rd year and on. Right now my plan is to invest 3.75% a month in my 403b and save the other 3.75% in my personal savings account with the plan to deposit what I saved into my 403b in my 2nd and 3rd years of employment so I can max out my employer contribution when they actually contribute. My question is, should I contribute more in the first year even if my employer doesn't match it? Right now I'll be contributing about $140/mo, and if I contributed the full 7.5% it would be $280. 

Some background information: I have strong savings accounts, have a month's salary set aside in a designated emergency fund (but I want to get that to 3 months), and I just opened a TD Ameritrade account and will be contributing monthly to that as well.

My mom passed away unexpectedly this week, she was in her 50's. She was still married to my dad after 40 years. Mom was the main caretaker for my grandma, her mother, but more on that later. Mom was a gambler, we all knew this, but we did not know the extent of her problems. It appears she was around $40k in debt, and hired a law firm to help with debt consolidation. She also just signed a contract to have solar panels put on the roof.  I have some questions. 1. Now that she is gone, what will happen to that debt? Will it be passed on to my father? She had credit card debt as well as large paypal account balance, and also had borrowed money from some small local loan companies. 2.  Are we still obligated to go forward with the solar panels?

Secondly, grandma. Apparently grandma closed a 6 figure bank account a few years ago and gave mom the money to invest. We assumed that money was gone, however we got a tip that there is a trust fund open in grandma's name, and maybe the missing money is there? How can we find the trust fund?

t3_gikqy7,Best Financial Strategy,"Hello everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

I was talking with my brother and I'm now trying to figure out the best way to set myself up for a better financial future. 

I currently have 36,000 in student loan debt.

I will be going to school in a few weeks to get a second bachelor's degree as a registered nurse. The tuition will be paid by the post 9/11 GI bill in conjunction with the Yellow Ribbon Program so I don't need to worry about that. 

While in school I will be making about 4,000 a month (tax free) between VA disability and the stipend from the GI bill.

I was originally going to take this time to aggressively pay off my student loans, but I'm now wondering if perhaps I should refinance to a lower rate, pay them off at a longer time and take the extra money and invest in the market. Right now my interest rates for the loans are at 0% until at least September due to the Coronavirus legislation. After that, I believe they sit somewhere at about 5%.

I have about 15k in savings, 3k in mutual funds, 15k in retirement, and 1k cash. I only pay 250 in rent, for the next year, but will move after that. 

What do you think it is that I should do?

t3_gikj2r,Buying A Home w/ Student Loans,"First-time Home Buyer (potentially) here in need of advice.

My wife and I recently welcomed our first child, and we are beginning to consider possibly leaving our rental and purchasing a home. We have been paying $1200/month for the last year and a half on our rental home, which is an old home but is enough space for our small family. Currently, before tax, our combined income is approx. 120k/year.

Growing up, my parents never owned a home, therefore I am extremely hesitant to take the plunge without careful evaluation. My primary hang up is that I recently graduated law school with $80k in student loans. Luckily, the $80k is the only debt that we have. Both cars are paid off and we have never used a credit card. I've recently started a stable job, therefore our plan is to begin to aggressively pay off this student loan in order to become debt free. If we were to purchase a home, we have agreed to keep it under $200k, which would buy a nice home in our area of the country.

My question is this: would it be smarter to pay off my student loan completely over the next 3-4 years/continue to rent before purchasing a home? Or is it feasible to own a home in that price range while simultaneously paying off the $80k? I feel that my earning capacity has great upside, but the thought of taking on additional debt on top of my student loans does make me hesitant, especially considering that there is not necessarily anything wrong with our current living situation. Should I save money for a down payment while also paying off the $80k? Or focus all energy towards the student loan?

t3_gik4y0,How Do I Get Cheaper Insurance? Cheaper Car Payment?,"Hi,

I’m 23 years old and I’ve been a licensed driver for almost three years. I have State Farm and pay 200 bucks a month for my 2017 Hyundai Sonata (full coverage).

So my question is, do you guys have any advice on how to get a better deal? I’ve never been in a crash, no speeding tickets, don’t drink or smoke, and I only really drive to and from work (or I did anyway).

When I first got with them I was paying around 300. 200 is obviously better but I can’t help but feel ripped off. I’ve been with the same company for a while now and I’m a good driver. Never missed a payment either.

Also I pay 383 a month for my car payment. I called the other day and my bank said that the pay out was 12,500. I have enough to pay it all off, but I was conflicted as to what I should do.

My mom says that it’s good to have a car payment because it shows that you’re reliable, but I’ve had it for 1 year and 7 months. Do I gain anything by continuing to have this payment? Is it better to just refinance it?

I don’t have much knowledge in these topics and I would appreciate some help.

Thanks.

t3_gijxdd,Graduated Payment Mortgage formula,"Hi PF community,

I wanted to see if anyone here who is either a math person or who specializes in mortgage amortization can help me through the application of a graduated-payment mortgage formula. The formula in question is equation 8 at the bottom of the 6th page of this document: https://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/D_Winkler_Graduated_1998(MULTI%20UNCG%20AUTHORS).pdf

My question is--how do I manipulate the formula to re-amortize partway through the repayment period? I'm not a math person at all, and I have to believe there's some algebra involved, or changing one of the exponents, or something like that. 

For example, say there are 5 payment tiers (the initial one followed by 4 graduations), and each payment tier lasts for 2 years before the next one, so this would be a 10-year graduated mortgage, or 120 monthly payments. Say I get the value for the initial payment, and then I derive the values of the other payments with PMT(1 + g)^t. But then, say the borrower becomes delinquent, or goes through a period of forbearance or whatever, and this occurs after month 6. Now, the lender re-amortizes the payments so that the mortgage is still paid off within 10 years. How now do I derive the value of the next 18 payments for the first tier, and then the corresponding 4 subsequent tiers?

This might be really simple--again, I'm not a math person.

I live in Southern Oregon and recently became a foster parent. My child is very self-conscious about their teeth, and I completely understand as I had similar issues as a kid and teen.

My experience was awful and I had ideations of extremely harmful actions for a very long time due to being uncomfortable in my own skin and other's words. Fortunately, I ended up getting orthodontia from my pediatric dentist for a short amount of time as he and my parents deemed it ""unnecessary."" Likewise, my child does not ""need"" orthodontia, but I can relate to how awful she may feel.

Her insurance through the state does not cover it. Any suggestions? Should we call around? Start a GoFundMe?

t3_gijoeg,Time To Talk About Job Search Scams,"I, like many others, am on the hunt for a new job. It's been a while since I sent out applications with this level of frequency and vigor. It's reminded me how much I hate looking for a job.

- My personal (and only) phone number
- My email address
- My home address
- Contact information for my references

I have already noticed an increase in robo-calls to my cell phone as well as text messages trying to sell me cbd oil or to follow suspicious links.

I am not sure I am in the right place for this. But I just want to vent my frustration with the modern job-search process and my discomfort with the privacy I am afforded. Also, are there any other shady tactics we should be on the lookout for?

That's the bad. The good is I have a job for a fortune 500 company for 13 years making 45k and the chance of that going away is low. No kids, car paid off ( I work from home, it's just for trips to the grocery store) and one 0% interest credit card with a 5k balance. 6k in savings. 

So, I found a solid tiny home for $37500. I have yet to find a mortgage company who will give a loan for that small amount. Even the banks known for small mortgages are really turned off by my foreclosure.

t3_gijgoh,is this an appropriate use of a credit card chargeback?,"Our wedding for early May was cancelled due to COVID.

t3_gijeue,Is it better to buy a house (And acquire debt) or have savings in your account? Please advice.,"Hey everyone, sorry for throwaway but I don't like mingling my personal/important business with my main/chilled account.

My family has sold an appartment and has about $127K in the bank from the sale. We are currently renting a house at $1200 per month. We also have close to 0 debt as of right now.

My mom wants to buy a house for around $160k and take a loan from the bank, in our current situation the only actual income is hers. My brother and his girlfriend can put some money up, but because of the pandemic affecting his area of work I'm not certain he can keep it coming or for how long he can sustain it. I've also been affected by the pandemic circumstances (not sick lol thank god) and am currently out of a job. No savings in any case either.

My brother might have some but definitely not a whole lot. If we bought the house we would have around $300 left after the bank's monthly fee to be used for electricity, water, and such. We would have around $30 for food and shit and my (older) brother and his gf are expected to chip in to cover the costs as well. I'm also expected to chip in as soon as I can get a job. We live in a third world country so keep that in mind, food is cheaper I assume than in the US or Europe.

So we have two options, please help me choose or consider them:

**OPTION 1:** We can rent and keep our savings until me and my brother can get going again so we stop using the savings cause of our better situation and then reasess if its worth purchasing or just keep renting until we're secure enough financially to buy. 

**OPTION 2:** We can buy now and have a secure roof for years to come, but have barely enough money to actually do anything. If my brother's area of work doesn't recover in due time we might be in serious financial trouble (in my opinion).

**Please read this** 

In my mind putting ourselves in such a risky financial situation by buying a house puts us way more in jeopardy than having savings in an account. It also allows us to take advantage of the pandemic by finding cheaper renting prices imo. 

The other point of view is that with the coming depression/recession, the economy will plummet, the dollar will lose its value and our savings will be worth shit by then so its better to spend on something tangible.

So, should we buy the house and get a loan or rent and assess in the future PLEASE ADVICE!

t3_giijno,Junk my old car for cash or keep it for parts?,"I don't have much experience in this regard, I'm 22, but I'm trying to do my own research and find what would be best for me in the long run. A month ago my (first car) broke down on the way home and I managed to get it into the driveway before it started grinding, steaming and a bunch of fluids just started hemorrhaging out of the bottom. Got it towed to a mechanic and long story short was told I needed a new motor. They quoted me much more than my car was worth (got it for 3500, was quoted 5). 

I had a huge chunk stored up in savings just for general all purpose use, and decided that it would be much more worth while to abandon ship on this one and get another used car. I did my research on how to look at and buy used cars and picked out a nice used corolla for 3000, 500 off asking price which was also in much, much better condition than my last car and has significantly less miles on it, and paid it all in cash, no less.

This leads me to my question, I do not have any mechanical hands-on experience working on cars, only book and general YouTube knowledge, nothing really advanced. Full disclosure, my first car buy was shit. I was quite stupid, barely test drove it or looked at it, and it was an endless money pit all the way up until the moment it died.

Another option would be a ""Cash Management Account"" which on their website was described as ""A brokerage account earmarked for everyday spending"" which I'm guessing is just a glorified checking account - it says it offers an ATM card.  With all of the market volatility currently, would it be smarter to just convert my points to cash and then transfer to a HYSA? (I have access to promotional checking/savings accounts which could yield 5%+ APY)  I guess the alternative would be to invest in the stock market perhaps dollar cost averaging to reduce the risk of ""buying high.""

t3_giifxv,Random debt collector notice,"So today my husband (28) got a notice from a debt collector (affiliate asset solutions llc) that they had purchased medical debt he owed from June 01, 2014.

At the time he was on his fathers insurance and he doesn't remember being charged for anything (he was on college and his father would have handled it since it was the fathers insurance). His father, bless him, doesn't keep records of damn near anything and hasn't been helpful.

The notice says we have 30 days from May 05, 2020 to dispute the debt claim otherwise the debt will be valid and they'll work to collect. Or something to that effect.

t3_gii3vs,Permanent DEFAULT credit card rates. Why?,"Something I don't quite understand: Back when the CARD act legislation was passed, why didn't they also put in provisions that would prevent credit card issuers from locking their customers into a permanent ""default"" interest rate (usually nearly 30%), rather than requiring them to drop the rate back down over time to the original rate after something like 6 or 9 months of on-time payments and ""good behavior""?

With all the positive changes that legislation produced, it seems that they missed a huge opportunity to prevent CC issuers from endlessly screwing their customers year after year by tricking them with a low rate, then as soon as they accidentally step on any ""late payment landmine"" ... BOOM! ... their default ""loan shark"" rate kicks in for the entire life of that card.

I remember missing a few payments on my Discover card around 18 or 20 years ago after which they immediately locked me into a 28.99% default rate and kept it there for all that time. They refused to lower it after repeated requests, even after almost 2 decades of perfect payments. The only option they offered was to close out my original card and open a brand new ""Discover It"" card, which meant possibly loosing my very long card history length and also paying some huge transfer fee to park my debt onto the new card. Fortunately, my high Discover balance is now $0 and has been for some time, for that very reason. They were simply too greedy when all I wanted them to do was lower my rate just a little. I finally decided to use an installment based loan to get rid of their excessively high interest payments. So rather than robbing me just a little less, they lost the whole shebang. I only keep my original Discover Card active because it is one of my oldest cards and I don't want the hits to my credit score and DTI for closing it right now. But I do wonder why the CARD act didn't simply put a stop to the filthy greedy practice of jacking up rates permanently. To me, it's a bait and switch and a huge overreach for even the smallest ""infraction"". Heck, even a full-blown bankruptcy is forgiven (no longer reported) eventually.

t3_gihzt8,FHA Logistics: Rent or Sell?,"Hello,
As we know, life happens and the projected path you saw yourself taking one day can change the next.  In this case, having an FHA loan is complicating that.  We bought our house back in October, so a little over seven months ago.  According to the information I've been able to dig up, occupancy for the FHA loan is a minimum of one year.  I see there are some exceptions, such as job relocation.  However, all the articles I can find only talk about FHA allowing you to buy a second property with a second FHA loan.  Specifically, we are trying to find out if job relocation will allow us to rent out the property ahead of the one year mark.  Otherwise, our options are to continue to pay for another five months and making it appear like we live there and then rent it out, or selling it for a major loss.  
The house was bought at $153k with 3.5% down.  Monthly payments including taxes, HOA, insurance, ect are under $1400 (taxes in the area are super high).  Rental market for the house would be around $1600.  From what I understand this isn't the greatest margin and wouldn't leave room to use a management company, we'd have to manage ourselves or have family in the area take care of small repairs and coordinate any larger ones that arise.  The good part is, while it is a single family home the HOA takes care of all roofing, siding, and landscape.  So there is no risk of a high cost repair to the exterior of the home.  All windows were recently replaced as well.  Our main risk with the house itself would come from plumbing or electrical issues arising (or some massive, unavoidable disaster).
The other, obvious, option is to sell.  I know that we have basically no equity built up at this point.  Down payment is a loss and 10% to cover sales expenses would be around $15k.  We don't even have $15k to cover the sales expenses at this point.  We'd also probably have to put in about $3k-5k or so to make the home more appealing.  The previous owner did a shotty job painting the cabinets in the kitchen, the stairs, and the vanity in the bathroom.  This can all easily be stripped and stained.  The appliances are mismatched, but at this price point of a home I don't see that as a huge deal.  We would want to put in new carpet in the bedrooms, it's not in horrible shape but could use a facelift.  Also, the doors are the ugly builder grade brown and we would want to put in white to make it look more polished.  These are all things we would do before renting it out anyway to make it more appealing and possibly getting more towards the $1700 range for rent (still within market). 
I'm mainly looking for advice on what the best course of action would be.  We're leaning towards making repairs, ""living there"" for 5 more months, and then renting it out.  However, we're not super well versed in running numbers on real estate and maybe a different option makes more sense.",personalfinance,fha logistics rent sell,hello know life happens projected path saw taking one day change next case fha loan complicating bought house back october little seven month ago according information able dig occupancy fha loan minimum one year see exception job relocation however article find talk fha allowing buy second property second fha loan specifically trying find job relocation allow rent property ahead one year mark otherwise option continue pay another five month making appear like live rent selling major loss house bought monthly payment including tax hoa insurance ect tax area super high rental market house would around understand greatest margin leave room use management company manage family area take care small repair coordinate larger one arise good part single family home hoa take care roofing siding landscape risk high cost repair exterior home window recently replaced well main risk house would come plumbing electrical issue arising massive unavoidable disaster obvious option sell know basically equity built point payment loss cover sale expense would around even cover sale expense point also probably put make home appealing previous owner shotty job painting cabinet kitchen stair vanity bathroom easily stripped stained appliance mismatched price point home see huge deal would want put new carpet bedroom horrible shape could use facelift also door ugly builder grade brown would want put white make look polished thing would renting anyway make appealing possibly getting towards range rent still within market mainly looking advice best course action would leaning towards making repair living month renting however super well versed running number real estate maybe different option make sense,fha logistics rent sell  know life happens projected path saw taking one day change next case fha loan complicating bought house back october little seven month ago according information able dig occupancy fha loan minimum one year see exception job relocation however article find talk fha allowing buy second property second fha loan specifically trying find job relocation allow rent property ahead one year mark otherwise option continue pay another five month making appear like live rent selling major loss house bought monthly payment including tax hoa insurance ect tax area super high rental market house would around understand greatest margin leave room use management company manage family area take care small repair coordinate larger one arise good part single family home hoa take care roofing siding landscape risk high cost repair exterior home window recently replaced well main risk house would come plumbing electrical issue arising massive unavoidable disaster obvious option sell know basically equity built point payment loss cover sale expense would around even cover sale expense point also probably put make home appealing previous owner shotty job painting cabinet kitchen stair vanity bathroom easily stripped stained appliance mismatched price point home see huge deal would want put new carpet bedroom horrible shape could use facelift also door ugly builder grade brown would want put white make look polished thing would renting anyway make appealing possibly getting towards range rent still within market mainly looking advice best course action would leaning towards making repair living month renting however super well versed running number real estate maybe different option make sense

t3_gi8b0z,Dentist estimate was 130% shy of actual cost,"Located in California. I have really good high option dental insurance. No yearly limit, covers 100% of ""class a"", 80% of ""class b"", 50% of ""class c"", etc.

Dentist is in network and estimated my out of pocket expenses as $939.80. Actual out of pocket they are requesting is $2,146.60. Just shy of 130% discrepancy. Seems like a fucking scam to me. Insurance said they paid the correct amount and recommended I work with the dentist.

I am aware that I am responsible for the difference. I typically set aside 10-20% higher than the estimate to cover the usual discrepancy. I think this is fucking insane and unacceptable though.

I've reviewed everything for my estimate they quoted everything at ""class B"" where insurance would cover 80%. When actuality some of it was ""class C"" only being covered at 50%. 

What are my options?

How should I approach the office workers to get this lowered?

There is additional work that needs to be done and they would lose out on about 5k more worth of work, if they don't work with me at all. Might use that as ammunition but  don't want to overstep or be rude. I know they can't possibly know exactly how much my insurance will ultimately pay.

t3_gih6xp,ROTH IRA - Minimum vs. Max out,"I'm just beginning to set up my roth IRA, but I'm a bit confused about how the Roth IRA works when there are minimum investments, but there is the $6000 cap for contribution. 

For example, Vanguard has some index funds that require a $3000 minimum investment. Does that mean if I put down the minimum investment for two index funds, I've already maxed out my contribution for the year, or am I missing something?

A different scenario would be to put the $3000 minimum investment on one, but invest in another one later on once I save up another $3000. But if I am reinvesting every month (e.g. 100$ monthly) to the initial Index Fund, does that mean I can't invest in the second one until next year, as I would be over the $6000 contribution limit? 

I may just be fundamentally misunderstanding how the Roth IRA works, so any clarification would be appreciated.

t3_gigg8n,Rent vs. Buy in HCOL California city,"My wife and I are both 30 and live in a California HCOL city where the median home price is \~$625k.  We are both in secure government jobs and make a combined $165k gross. We'd really like to move from a 2+2 apartment (rented at $2k) to a single-family home sometime in the next 1-3 years and are hoping to get a downpayment saved up by then. However, we won't get to a 20% downpayment (\~$125k) for another 5 years. We just started our downpayment fund after aggressively paying down existing credit card debt and currently have a $10k downpayment balance with future contributions estimated at $2k/month.

My question is this: We'd like to take advantage of the State's CalHFA loan and downpayment assistance programs before we exceed the income limit (set at $170k for our county). Should we jump at the opportunity to enroll in the program now, or are we better off continuing to rent and building up our downpayment?

When I plug all relevant info into the NYT Rent vs. Buy calculator, it always churns out a number that is very similar to the rent that we are paying now, so I feel like we are on the cusp of seeking out homeownership.

Other things you should know: We have a fully funded 6-month emergency fund. We are maxing out our employer-sponsored retirement plans and Roth IRA contributions. I have $6k in student loan debt and estimate it will be paid off in 5 months. She has \~$90k in student loan debt, but she's also enrolled in the PSLF program and is a little bit over halfway through the program. My car is paid off and her car still has $18k balance on it.

My loan is going to be for 72 months @ 3.39%, but I plan on making larger payments at the start to pay off the principal faster.

t3_gig35x,Automated in-plan Roth 401k conversion &amp; associated mega backdoor questions,"I recently learned that my employer's 401k provider was allowing automatic in-plan conversions of after-tax contributions to become Roth contributions. My understanding is that after I hit the $19,500 cap of pre-tax contributions withheld from my paycheck, I have the option to continue contributing on an after-tax basis. This automated in-plan conversion feature would then automatically convert them to Roth 401k contributions. All of my contributions to date have been traditional pre-tax 401k contributions. Does this mean that there would be a separate Roth sub-account within my 401k? How are the funds and associated earnings separated?

I have read about the ""mega backdoor Roth"" that allows you to contribute up to $57,000, minus employer contributions and minus the $19,500 of my own money already contributed. Is it this after-tax money that had been automatically converted in-plan to Roth that can be rolled over to a separate Roth IRA? What is the difference between keeping it in an in-plan Roth 401k versus a separate Roth IRA? I already have my own personal Roth IRA which I put $6,000 a year into. Is it this same Roth IRA I would be moving this in-plan converted 401k money into? They are both with Fidelity.

My employer does allow in-service non-hardship withdrawals but the SPD mentions there is a $20 fee for such withdrawals. Is a rollover to a Roth IRA with the same provider (Fidelity) considered a withdrawal subject to this fee? Is there any way to avoid this fee? If not, how often should I be doing the rollover in light of the fee?

I tried to increase the amount of $ to contribute after learning of these automated in-plan after-tax conversions to Roth, but the plan limits me to 30% of my paycheck across all sources (pre-tax, Roth, and after-tax contributions). I make $80k-$90k a year. Therefore, since my employer match is 4.5%, and I can only contribute up to 30% of my own paycheck, it seems impossible for me to hit the $57,000 max, right?

t3_gibnjj,High Yield Savings Account Fiasco,"This is more of a rant, but I still wanted to share because it's hilarious and you can laugh at me. And then hopefully I can get some insight on easier ways to do this in the future...

Objective: Move a semi-large amount of cash from my savings (Growth) account with PNC (.15% APY) to a new Capital One 360 High Yield Savings account (1.5% APY). There was a promo for a $100 bonus **for every $10,000 deposited within 10 days of opening**. The amount I wanted to move is $30,000. Normally I wouldn't really care, I know the HYS rates are probably going to go down any day now, but I figured why not take advantage of the ""free"" $300 in bonus money and hang onto the higher APY as long as I can.

Here is what I did:

* Day 1 Friday: Got set up on my new CapOne 360 Account. Added my wife as a joint account holder. Easy Peasy. However, hindsight being 20/20, I should have opened this account on a Monday and not a Friday night. Possibly an issue later on with the 10 day funding period.
* Day 2-3-4 Saturday-Sunday-Monday: Set up my external account for CapOne360 at PNC for online transfer. Wait for the two small deposits to verify the account link. I see them on Monday and verify the account.
* **Problem: Daily external transfer limit with PNC is $15,000, Monthly Transfer limit $25,000.** Shit\*\*.\*\* I now realize that I will not be able to use this method to get the $300 bonus I wanted, and at most I could only get the $200 bonus with this method. I really should have looked into limits before hand, but it never really crossed my mind. Oh well.. let's call PNC.
* Day 4.5 Monday: Call PNC and go through the telephone wire transfer service. The guy on the phone talks me out of doing it over the phone because a.) I have never done a wire transfer over the phone with PNC before and I need to fill out paperwork with them b.) it will probably take about 45 minutes to 1 hour on the phone with him to get it set up. He says if there is a local branch near me that I could do a drive-thru wire transfer during the COVID stuff. Since I did not have an hour at that time to work with him on the phone I decided I would try going to the branch drive-thru. I call the only branch that's a reasonable distance to me and they did not answer the phone.. sigh.
* Day 4.75 Monday evening: Well this day is shot. So I initiate a transfer to my new account for $15,000 just to get something going in case I can't get it all there within the 10 days. Knowing there is a daily limit, I then schedule a $10,000 transfer the following day getting to my maximum $25,000 monthly transfer. Then I write a personal check to myself for $5000 (Daily CapOne Mobile Deposit Limit) and do a mobile deposit to my new Cap One 360 account. This part actually worked the smoothest.
* Day 5 Tuesday: **Problem: PNC emails me and says my $10,000 transfer has been canceled because it exceeded my monthly limit**. DUH.. I have other transfers/bills scheduled to go to external accounts regularly. Completely forget that would eat into my monthly limits. Now I'm thinking, the personal check worked so well.. I'll just write 2 more $5000 checks to myself and deposit them in the app. WRONG. **Problem: $10,000 mobile deposit monthly limit with CapOne360**. So at most I could do one more $5000 personal check to myself this month and have to figure out an alternate way to get the remaining $5000 to my new account before the 10 days is up.

Summary: I took a relatively easy concept, and I thought I could save time by doing stuff online. If I would have done my homework I would have gone with the paperwork route and the hour on the phone.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I did one more personal check, and was able to schedule a $5000 delivery out of PNC to cap one 360 for tomorrow. Keeping under my $25k monthly cap. Unfortunately I'm still within a 24 hour window of my last mobile deposit.. so more to come on that if I can deposit it tonight.

The other question remains.. ~~will everything clear by the 18th to get my $300 bonus. I'm betting not.~~

Edit 2: I confirmed with Capital One 360 that as long as the initiation of the transfer is done before the 10 days then I'll be ok.",personalfinance,high yield saving account fiasco,rant still wanted share hilarious laugh hopefully get insight easier way future objective move semi large amount cash saving growth account pnc apy new capital one high yield saving account apy promo bonus every deposited within day opening amount wanted move normally really care know hys rate probably going day figured take advantage free bonus money hang onto higher apy long day friday got set new capone account added wife joint account holder easy peasy however hindsight opened account monday friday night possibly issue later day funding period day saturday sunday monday set external account capone pnc online transfer wait two small deposit verify account link see monday verify account problem daily external transfer limit pnc monthly transfer limit shit realize able use method get bonus wanted could get bonus method really looked limit hand never really crossed mind well let call pnc day monday call pnc telephone wire transfer service guy phone talk phone never done wire transfer phone pnc need fill paperwork probably take minute hour phone get set say local branch near could drive thru wire transfer covid stuff since hour time work phone decided would try going branch drive thru call branch reasonable distance answer phone sigh day monday evening well day shot initiate transfer new account get something going case get within day knowing daily limit schedule transfer following day getting maximum monthly transfer write personal check daily capone mobile deposit limit mobile deposit new cap one account part actually worked smoothest day tuesday problem pnc email say transfer canceled exceeded monthly limit duh transfer bill scheduled external account regularly completely forget would eat monthly limit thinking personal check worked well write check deposit app wrong problem mobile deposit monthly limit capone could one personal check month figure alternate way get remaining new account day summary took relatively easy concept thought could save time stuff online would done homework would gone paperwork route hour phone edit one personal check able schedule delivery pnc cap one tomorrow keeping monthly cap unfortunately still within hour window last mobile deposit come deposit tonight question remains everything clear get bonus betting edit confirmed capital one long initiation transfer done day ,high yield saving account fiasco rant still wanted share hilarious laugh hopefully get insight easier way future objective move semi large amount cash saving growth account pnc apy new capital one high yield saving account apy promo bonus every deposited within day opening amount wanted move normally really care know hys rate probably going day figured take advantage free bonus money hang onto higher apy long day friday got set new capone account added wife joint account holder easy peasy however hindsight opened account monday friday night possibly issue later day funding period day saturday sunday monday set external account capone pnc online transfer wait two small deposit verify account link see monday verify account problem daily external transfer limit pnc monthly transfer limit shit realize able use method get bonus wanted could get bonus method really looked limit hand never really crossed mind well let call pnc day monday call pnc telephone wire transfer service guy phone talk phone never done wire transfer phone pnc need fill paperwork probably take minute hour phone get set say local branch near could drive thru wire transfer covid stuff since hour time work phone decided would try going branch drive thru call branch reasonable distance answer phone sigh day monday evening well day shot initiate transfer new account get something going case get within day knowing daily limit schedule transfer following day getting maximum monthly transfer write personal check daily capone mobile deposit limit mobile deposit new cap one account part actually worked smoothest day tuesday problem pnc email say transfer canceled exceeded monthly limit duh transfer bill scheduled external account regularly completely forget would eat monthly limit thinking personal check worked well write check deposit app wrong problem mobile deposit monthly limit capone could one personal check month figure alternate way get remaining new account day summary took relatively easy concept thought could save time stuff online would done homework would gone paperwork route hour phone edit one personal check able schedule delivery pnc cap one tomorrow keeping monthly cap unfortunately still within hour window last mobile deposit come deposit tonight question remains everything clear get bonus betting edit confirmed capital one long initiation transfer done day

What can I do if they decide to stop being flexible?,"Not sure if this is the right place to post, but basically I have been with my employer for 8 year and 4 years ago I decided to go back to school to get my degree. I’ve been doing online and evening classes mainly, some semesters I wold leave work early one or two days and work was always fine with it.

Correct me if I'm wrong. It looks like they canceled payments for 6 months, but still collect interest during that period.

Don't forget it knocked a few points off my credit score. 

They didn't notify me, y'all should check yourselves.

t3_gifvh9,TD dropped my credit score by 200 points due to an error on their side. Help?,"I pay my TD credit card bill in full every month via my TD bank app along with my other bills. It's part of my bill pay ritual. Apparently a recent payment that I initiated has a processing error. TD bank called me to inquire about a late payment, which I payed in full immediately and they assured me that it wouldn't be an issue and that everything was fine. A few weeks later I receieve a notice that my credit limit on my CC has been decreased several thousand dollars due to a late payment, and I see my credit score has dropped nearly 200 points (from \~820 to \~660). For the record, I've never had a late payment in since I got this card (or my other card), and I have no other outstanding negative issues with my credit.

I tried calling TD and the representative acknowledged that they have record of me attempting to make a payment on time that had an error, and that it was followed up by a late payment. They are telling me it's out of their hands because the report was already sent out to the credit agencies. I am waiting to here back from a ""supervisor"" but due to covid-19 related issues there is a several day queue for a call back. Trying to dispute the claim on Experian says that if the payment was eventually submitted, but was still late, there will likely be no change. I still tried to submit under ""other issue,"" but I do not have high hopes.

So is there anything I can do? 200 points feels like an insane drop over something like this. I was in the process of saving up for a down payment on a house and now I feel like my ability to get a decent loan in the next year or two is completely destroyed. Is there a way for TD to send an amended report and increase my credit back? I feel like a drop like this can take years to recover from.

Is that duration extended even for people with just a short few months of work/fund contribution before getting laid off?

I wouldn’t really need to withdraw it until I place a down payment on a house in maybe 2 years time. But at the same time I’d maybe want it to be accessible in the event of an emergency.

I understand that there are some ‘high-yield’ savings accounts out there, that pay like 1.5% APY over the year...which i feel is a real negligible amount at the end of the day. There has to be a better place to park this money and earn more return on it.

t3_giff13,Staying after giving notice or going to a job that pushed back my start date?,"So I’ve been a healthcare provider for a while now and my current job, first job, was created when the hospital did an audit and realized they were missing out/sending away patients because they didn’t have enough beds. The hospital I work for then created a unit and hired staff to fill this unit with 1/2 medicine and 1/2 specialty patients. Since I’ve worked there we’ve never really made the numbers or had the volume that was projected and it’s been really frustrating waiting every few months to hear if they would give up the specialty beds and make it all medicine, or if we would survive to work through another 3 month trial period.

I understandably felt really frustrated as I had a long commute and I  was working a job that I felt was temporary because of how uncertain our future was. Long story short, I applied and was offered a job at a major teaching hospital 15 minutes from my house. I would be working on a tight-knit team in a booming field of medicine. I gave my notice and would be leaving my first job on good terms. The hiccup came when, 2 weeks after I  gave my notice, the teaching hospital pushed back my start date by 2 months. 

I ended up talking to my current boss and they said they would do what they could to help get me some hours and keep me on the insurance for as much of those 2 months as possible. They also let me know that my leaving was a wake-up call and they completely restructured my current job and it’s actually a pretty good gig at this point. They have asked me if I’m sure I still want to leave.

My question is, has anyone been in a similar situation? Do you think it would still be wise to go to the teaching hospital after they’ve pushed back my start date (I’ve already sent in my credentialing documents)? I think one of my major concerns is that we are in the middle of a pandemic and if anything goes wrong with the new job I’d be screwed because now that they’ve offered to keep me after I’ve already given my notice I can’t just go back if I say no now.

Recent college graduate with 52k in savings, couple of retirement accounts (both under 10k), 6k in brokerage account with USAA (transferring to Schwab in a couple weeks), and a salary of 55k. I am in a highly advantageous position where my monthly bills are only totaling around $500. 

Been trying to think of the best way to invest the 52k. The options I am currently considering are:

* Moving around half of the savings to Schwab in a couple week's time
* Going back to school to pursue Master's (30k investment over two years)
* Or leave in savings account and appreciate the lower dividends over time

t3_giat3f,Suggestions: Voluntary Separation Package,"My company recently is offering a rather interesting Voluntary Separation Package due to COVID-19 and cost cutting. The package is:

- minimum of 45 weeks paid to all employees that take it - no matter how long you worked there.  
- 100% full prior year bonus
- 18 months employer subsidized medical coverage under cobra 
- 6 months outplacement assistance (initiate within 1 year)
- 100% vesting of retirement plans

The last day of service would be November 2nd so you practically are finishing out this year with a job. Which I think is a big factor when seeking next employment, hopefully economy will be better early 2021. 

If there is not enough participation in the package then they would result to involuntary layoffs which would be roughly 60% of the current offer’s value. 

I have been there for 6 years so based on the package I would be paid out 51 weeks of salary (almost a year) plus my bonus equal to the amount I received this past March. 

Things for me to consider:
I am in my late 20s with various security licenses that I feel like I could land a job fairly easily. Ironically I have been interviewing outside with a company already that I think I would be getting an offer but they are waiting for their building to open back up versus start me remote. But if their start date is earlier than probably October and then I would not get the package leaving early. 

I currently have one rental property with a long term tenant and I offer AirBnB on the other rooms. He lost his job at the beginning of covid but now has a new job. He is behind on rent 1 month but should be able to catch up now that he is employeed. 

I am closing on a new primary home end of June. 

Any feedback on what you would do if you were in my shoes?

t3_gies7l,Should I refinance my home to a 30 year and pay more per month towards principal or a 15 year?,"My husband and I are looking to refinance, but we can’t decide if we want to do 30 year or 15 year. Originally we thought 15 year for sure because we want to pay off our house as soon as possible, but due to the recent pandemic we were thinking if something happened and he lost his job, it would be way easier to come up with a smaller monthly payment. So then we were thinking, should we do 30 year and technically have a smaller payment, but then just get in the habit of making a monthly payment of like $2000(extra towards principal) while times are good, if something happened and he lost his job then we would only need to do about $1300 instead of $1883? But we don’t know if that’s a good idea or not. 

We plan on staying in this house at least for the next 5 years, but our long term goal is to eventually move and keep this house as a rental. So that’s weighing into our decision too. If we have a $1883 mortgage with the 15 year but we can only rent it out for like $1500? 

So we really need some advice on what would be the best decision for us. I think at this point we may be leaning towards the 30 year, but we wanted to get some advice before committing to a decision.

Is live in WA, and my company is based in NH.

First. My company uses a third party payroll system. ADP. Depending on how your company is set up if you use a third party for payroll they may also be your employer on UI’s system. So you work for company X but they use Company Y for payroll then your technical employer could be Y. Check that first. This turned out not to be my issues but it was a friends.

Second. WA’s UI dept sent my company a fax after we were deemed nonessential requesting information. Not an email, not a call but a fax. And they didn’t think to follow up after the fax so my status never left “pending”. So not only was nobody working but it was sent via a relic of past times. If you still have access to an HR or payroll department have them check for a fax. If they did get one they need to fax the information back and have them wait for confirmation.

Third. Most states you will qualify for food assistance. Their system is not bogged down nor is it over complicated. I applied on a Thursday, had an interview on a Friday and the EBT card by Tuesday. I got $350/mo (married, WA state) and a friend of mine got $150 (single, NV).

t3_gid89h,Should I put my savings account money into my Roth IRA?,"Hello,

I have a Roth IRA that I regularly put money into, but not enough to reach the maximum yearly contribution. This account is for the purposes of retirement savings.

I also have a savings account, in which I keep four paychecks worth of funds. This account is for emergencies. 

My understanding is that you can remove money from your Roth IRA without paying a penalty as long as it is just the money you put into it, and not money you've generated within it.

So my question is, is there any reason I shouldn't move money from my savings to my Roth IRA, to make the maximum yearly contribution?

t3_gid05j,Apartment saying I still owe after move out.,"Hey all, 

I moved out of my old apartment right before thanksgiving. Sometime in December I was sent my final invoice which said after they used my deposit I still owed $150 (cats messed up the carpet). I called the company that handles the apartments payment and paid on the phone with my credit card. Fast forward to January when I was paying my CC bill I saw a $150 charge to some strange LLC I had never seen before, looked into the company online and thought someone had got ahold of my CC and made the charge so I disputed it with my CC company.

About an hour after disputing the charge I realized that was the payment to my apartment and was a legit charge. I called my bank and they undid the dispute. However because it was a relatively small amount they had automatically approved the dispute and charged back the LLC. So now my CC statements show the following charges on the same day:
original charge to LLC for $150
refund sent back to me for $150
second charge to LLC for $150

The issues comes in that the LLC is saying I haven't paid them. They say all they see on their side is original charge being sent and then the original charge been taken back. I have sent them screen shots of my CC statements that show what I had outlined above and they passed it onto their finance team. At this point they said they are going to wait until the end of May to see if anything changes. 

My hopes are they are going to find the second charge and all is good. However on the phone they seem to be taking the approach that I still owe them money and if I can't prove I have already paid they are going to keep calling me.

t3_gi24l4,Vested RSUs: to sell or not to sell,"Hi there! I have a question for a friend who is not, in fact, me.

My friend works for a company that offers RSUs as part of his compensation. Let’s say he makes 90k as his base compensation but his RSUs are worth roughly 20k right now. These RSUs vest on the 31st of January each year and will be worth, at that time, whatever 200 RSUs are worth from the company.

We were chatting when he had a question about whether he should take out half his RSUs this year and pay off a credit card debt of 10k.

I know as his RSUs vest they’re included on his W2, but when he had his taxes done for 2019 he had been advised that since he sells the stock before he has had them for a year, he is taxed higher on them, but if he waits a year he can cash them out for capital gains instead, which is a difference of 24% because he’ll have less than 40k total in capital gains.

I went on investopedia to try to figure this out, since to me that sounds like he’d be double taxed, but I couldn’t figure out what we were even looking for, though I did read the entire article on RSUs and Capital Gains as well as looking at what tax bracket he’d be in. I did ask the guy who did his taxes but he was high and playing Smash, so I encountered some miscommunication.

Anyway, the core of the question is “is it worth it to save 15% APR on a 10k credit card balance by cashing out RSUs that vested January 31st this year?”

Hi there! Currently I'm working full time making about $2200 a month while living at home. My main goal has been to increase my income but I am wondering how you would split up your savings in my position.

I have been aiming to save 800 per paycheck and have built and emergency fund of $5000. I was wondering how would you split up your savings? My plan so far has been, 400-500 per paycheck in VEQT, 200-300 for either building emergency fund more or saving for something like travel and the rest for misc expenses like bills and food.

I'm seeing if I am able to increase my income without school, so the only big expense I can see myself going into in the future is potentially a business, but have no plans of one in the immediate future.

I don't plan on moving out for a few years at least while I plan what I want to do for the future.

My job appears to be secure as sales have been meeting goals during the pandemic. As for growth, I work  at a  dealership so If I can improve sales I can leverage for a raise

Short term I'm looking to self teach coding and and other valuable skills in order to increase my income. Long term  I could see myself renting my own place.

I've checked my credit score and aside from one 60 day late payment (&lt;$10 balance, just totally forgot I had the card... my bad...), it seems my lack of credit lines are hurting my score/making the impact of the late payment much higher. Here's my credit history:

2017: Opened car loan

2018: Opened cashback card

2019: 60 Day late payment

They said I'd be getting a new offer at the end of this summer regardless of whether I accepted this one, so I decided to reject it just in case other opportunities came up. Well, since COVID has hit, I'm not going to teach abroad, and I've decided to begin my career. All my coworkers have encouraged me to apply to other jobs in town so I can negotiate.

I've only gotten one response (probably due to COVID but who knows) and I had three interviews with different sectors within their company. From what it says online, the new company starts out at about 74K and doesn't have great 401K options. My current company's 401K options are about average for the industry.

I haven't asked my current employer to be promoted to full time yet. Since the new company's starting pay will likely be less than I was previously offered, I'd likely have to ask them for more before asking my current employer for more. Because of lockdown and me basically having to ask for a promotion at my current company, I'd love some advice for handling this in the most professional way possible.

He has his cell number and email listed when I attempt to reset my password.

t3_giblks,Inherited additional monthly income by way of a mortgage on a sold commercial property,"Hi there. So i read the wiki and really didnt know where this fit.

Per the title, the family trust created by mu grandfather revolved around a large piece of commercial property which was just finally sold to one of the current tenants. He took on 20-year mortgage instead of paying cash up front, and because of this, the inheritance to all of the family members went from being an expected windfall to a monthly sum paid out over 20 years.

For my situation: I am 37, making $135K/yr, with an established emergency fund, a roth IRA (never maxed on any year), and a 401K that has sat dormant for 2 years.

I have a checking and savings (used as my emergency fund) account with a single bank, some, my IRA with Vanguard, and some trivial investment stuff.

My not-well-defined plan had me thinking id use the windfall inheritance to buy a house, but now that its no longer a windfall, im not really sure what to do to best accommodate that kind of plan. Should I open an account at a new location and just keep dumping this new income into there? Should I maybe just consider it part of my current salary and forge ahead with bolstering retirement funds?

t3_gib4gp,"My Mom Got an Updated Card, but I just Made a Payment with her Old One (SLU)","Hi, I'm 19 and very green in the ways of finance, but I'm concerned my mom may have accidentally opened a new card. Her bank recently issued an email announcing that they'd be changing to chip cards and that the original card would no longer be supported. She now has a new card with a completely new number, and a new code on the back, which seems suspicious to me, because if it were simply a replacement for her last card it'd make sense to just replace the same credentials with the chip card and destroy the old one. So now she has 2 cards with 2 different numbers, and she told me that the previous one was already cancelled.

Except I just paid for a phone with her old card. Don't worry, we planned for it together, but the thing is, it went through.

t3_gii3ny,"Have been reading Rich Dad and Poor Dad for over a decade, what lessons have I learned?","Disclaimer- I am not giving advice to you. It is about me talking to myself. If you could help me out by telling me how naive I am and where the plan is wrong and not practical so that I could improve my future self. I NEED YOUR ADVICE.  

 The first time I read this book was when I was in 9th grade. I have never fully understood the concepts presented in this book until I encountered those concepts myself through different life experiences. Obviously, this book is a start. I try to keep it simple. These concepts just keep you on the right path, but how you get there is up to you. Walk, run, fly, crawl. Just finish it. Remember “No matter what he does, every person on earth plays a central role in the history of the world. And normally he doesn't know it.” Having the right mindset is critical. Making money is the next step, but this book does not show how to. It does but vaguely. Well, you need somewhere to start, and this book is a great place to do so. Let's get into it. Robert has two dads. One is poor and the other one is rich. He boiled lessons he learned from two dads down into 6 lessons.

The first lesson is that the rich do not work the money. One quote that got me pondered for so many years when I first read it. “The Poor work for money, while the Rich have the money work for them” What did Robert mean when he said the rich have money work for them? Is it that the rich have some magic turn money into some kind of bus boy and boss them around all day long?. If so, sign me up. I finally understood this concept when I was introduced to stock. Stock is not a piece of paper. There is a business behind it. If I can not optimize my money, let somebody use it and return me with principal plus interest. All I do is have a good night's sleep.

I remembered one of my friends told me that he invested his money in his personal car. He had all the accessories and top of the line car. I laughed at it because I believe a car can never hold its value unless he buys the car, fixes it and sells it for profit. To me, a car is just a tool getting me from point A to point B. That is why it is important to understand the second lesson: the difference between assets and liabilities. Assets are what puts money into your pocket and liabilities are what takes money out of your pocket. Assets are houses, stocks and businesses. What makes you money, not take money away from you.

The third lesson is mind your own business. I prefer to call it that profits are better than wages. You either work for a company, government or the bank. You need to have financial independence. What I mean by financial independence is that you are able to live from your own resources. Thinking about getting fire from your job the next morning. The fourth lesson is taxes. Both rich and poor are trying to earn money. The difference is that the rich spend their earnings before they pay taxes and the poor do the opposite. How do the rich do that?. You have to learn the power of corporations and accounting. This gets me to the fifth lesson: the rich invent money.

The fifth chapter is more like when I close my eyes, I can't see. It divides into 4 subsections- accounting, invest, market and laws. Accounting, you have to understand the numbers so that you could spend your hard earned money before the Fed has their hands on it. This explanation is more abstract and technical. The better way to explain it is to use accounting to keep track of your spending. Otherwise, it is like you eat and have diarrhea at the same time. You need imodium man. The best way to do it is to spend your money with cash instead of a credit card. Next, investing means keep your cash flow. This could be through bonds, stock and real estate. Stocks are easy. If you are an average investor, VOO fund is the way to go. Why? Check out your probability of beating the market. Real estate remembers one rule- Value added or Turning trash into gold. Find a house that needs to be fixed. Buy it, fix it and sell it. For every dollar you put in, you could get 4$ back. Market is full of opportunities. It is all about supply and demand. You gotta keep your eyes open and pay careful attention to what the market demands. These opportunities for you to innovate and fulfill the needs of the market. Golden rule- Ignorance of law is not an excuse for any crimes that you commit. Know the law, at least the basics, understand your rights and think like a lawyer. The reason I got into law is because when I play a board game with my friends, I see that whoever understands the rules of the game the most, wins the game because they are able to manipulate the game into their advantages. This applies to real life too. If watching “Making a murderer” does not make your hand stand straight up while thinking that you could be the one wasted 18 years for intentionally wrongfully convicted, think again. On the other hand, if you would like to get away with murder like O.J, law may be the first tool.

The last lesson is that learning to earn is more important than earning itself.The average student earns 11$ per hour. I earned 19$ per hour working as a Pharmacy Intern. I quit my job to participate in the PSSNY business plan competition. People say that I am stupid because this hospital pharmacy intern is hard to come by. There is a limited number of hospitals compared to chain pharmacies. If I work 20 hours per day, every week of the month, every month of the year, I could earn up to 18,240$ compared to 125$ for winning the competition that took me the whole year to prepare. Why I still pick the competition over the job, if I get to choose it all over again and never regret one bit. I learned how to be a leader and take responsibility and motivate others. I could earn much more in the future.

Theory is just a theory if you can not apply it. There are a lot of obstacles that you have to overcome. They include fear, cynicism, lazy, bad habits and arrogance. Fear is nothing but the suffering itself. Lazy is when you don't have enough reasons to thrive. Bad habit is your nature and hard to overcome unless you understand the mechanism of habit is cue-routine-reward and start to manipulate it. Cynicism is funny because if you die today doing what you love, will dying still be a problem anymore. Arrogance is simply that you need to shut up and listen. Beyond all of this, the first step is a big step. I am lazy to run every day. But I tricked myself. How about I change my clothes and drive my car to the bike trail. If I get there and I still do not change your mind, I could always drive back home and continue to do whatever I am doing at the moment. But it  has never happened that I drive back to my house after getting there. . Well if you make it to here, thank you so much. Comment below. Let me know what you think.

t3_ghuybt,"Should I keep the steady job I hate in an expensive area, or have free rent but no income?","I have a job that provides steady hours and health insurance. I'm lucky to be able to work mostly from home  through the pandemic and my job is not at risk of going away. I live in a very expensive area, though, and I'm not a very skilled worker so almost all of my money goes to rent. I'm only able to save around $6-8k a year (just enough for my Roth IRA with a little extra). 

However, before the pandemic hit I was planning on quitting. My grandparents have a lake home across the country that I can spend several months at for free, and then I was going to use a small inheritance I got a few years back to buy a cheap rural house with some land in cash. My dream is to have a garden and some chickens and work 10-15 hours a week at any old job just to have enough money to cover property taxes, extra groceries, maintenance projects, etc. I have friends who live this life and it's been my dream for years.

I feel like I'd be an idiot to quit a steady job right now and give up my health insurance, but I've been planning on starting this new life for years and I'm really at the end of my rope with my boss. Advice?

I'm not sure I can max out both so I'm trying to suss out the pros and cons of each. What are the big benefits to funding and converting the IRA first? Or should I max out the 401k first despite no company matching and then contribute as much as I can to the back door IRA before year end?

t3_gia7u9,"203(k) fallout, what to do with the excess from the loan?","Hello!

Throwaway because I don't want people knowing my main's financial stuff. TL;DR at the end.

~Prelude
So, recently (as in *immediately* before the COVID outbreak in the US), I broke down and finally purchased a house, because I was getting tired of rental problems. After searching for a couple (6+ months), and getting financed at a decent at the time (3.65%) rate, I found a house I wanted (HUD @ 136k), submitted a reno list (part of a 203(k), the ""official"" estimates came in around 30k, had to set aside some for inspections and stuff and I had to slush a percentage, so let's call it an even 175k). Wasn't a terrible deal overall, because it immediately appraised at 200k, even before the renovations. The contractor is a personal friend of mine, so we came in *well* under budget. Like, total costs were 16k out of 30k. Doesn't help that we had to use HUD guidelines for prices, which are absurd. Bank didn't like that, so with the HUD consultant's help (which is a necessary evil in these kinds of projects), we submitted some documents that take the full loan amount out and I get a check for the balance (14k).

~Info on my debts
For the down payment, I took out an FHA loan, and borrowed some money from my 401(k), which I contribute fully to every year. This loan is almost paid off, and has no interest rate.

For a while, i wasn't great at finances, and I'm trying to get better. Had a while where I had to credit card, with no emergency fund. I owe approximately 12k on them, the interest rates are fairly high (22.99% - they're both cash back cards)

I've been paying on my student loans, slowly but grinding them down. I currently owe about 16k (6.8% interest rate) on them total.

I'm leaning towards paying off the credit cards and throwing the balance on the student loans. Is this the right idea? Or should I pay a chunk of the CCs off (maybe down around 20-25%) and put the balance on the student loan?

TL;DR: 203(k) loan (175k @ 3.65%) was botched due to nepotism, so I got money (14k) back from it. Put it back on the house, pay off the CCs (12k @ 22.99%), pay off the student loans (16k @ 6.8%), pay back the 401k loan( almost done - less than 6 payments left, 0%), or some combination?

t3_gia70e,"31, living in an expensive city, a bit behind in savings but making improvements -- realistic goal to buy/mortgage a house in 10-15 years?","Hi all.

I'm 31, working a low-mid level job in government making 61k in the DC area, with a hopeful promotion (fingers crossed) up to 75k after I hit the 1-year mark, and future promotions/job opportunities that I'll look for in the years ahead.  

Sometimes I get down on myself because I feel like I'm behind where I should be at 31-- income wise and savings wise.  Thankfully I have little debt (2k left in student loans, and I pay my credit card off every month) but I only got this 61k job recently, after being at 30k-52k for 5 years.  In that time, it was difficult to really save any money.

So here I am-- $2500 to my name, throwing 20% of my income into my savings account to generate an emergency fund, contributing the maximum I can for government to max my TSP (401k equivalent), and shooting for more career growth.  Once I have my emergency fund built, I'd like to start saving for a downpayment on a house and/or contributing to a Roth IRA. 

I know that I'm on an upward trajectory, but I can't help but look at just how much a condo/house would cost in the areas in-and-around DC that I'm looking at.  On the low end of what I'd love to have, we're talking 700k condos. I feel like it's going to take 10-15 years to save up enough for a down payment, let alone the 30-year mortgage that would follow.  Granted, I'm basing that off my 61k income and not the 100k+ I'd like to earn in a higher government position, so I know things will speed up.

Anyway-- I dont know quite what I'm looking for here on PF.  Maybe I'm just looking to validation that I'm thinking about things the right way, or maybe I'm trying to get a reality check that I'm not ready to start thinking about this stuff?  Any feedback is welcome.  

(Also worth noting-- I'm currently single and planning my finances as if I will be single.

t3_gia23c,Has anyone here laid foundation or brick for a mobile home for it to be considered a house for a mortgage?,"I've heard a few people talk about this, but none of them have actually done it. I have just been gifted 2 acres of farm land (ny name is on the deed) and I have been pre approved for a $75,000 mortgage. I found a new mobile home for $50,000 and have a family friend who can put a well and septic tank on the land for $8,000. 

My main concern is that banks finance mobile homes different than houses. I've considered modular homes and building a house on site, but those would be a lot less square foot per dollar. Would the mobile home have to be financed, bricked, then refinanced as a house or can this be done from the beginning?

t3_gidq3b,Is now the worst time to get a house or the best? (USA),"My husband says no way while I see opportunity. 
Reasons to No 
--COVID 19 unemployment on husband's part, income is currently higher with +$600/wk  COVID benefits.
--we are blessed with an under-market-rate rental which we'd have to give up. House payment would be approximately 4x greater.
--This would massively deplete savings leaving us with ~$10k after transaction + another ~$8 in investments.
--Recession this winter is likely and could shake up our employment in unforseen ways.
--Change is scary, especially now

Reasons to Go
--House is what we want and where we want it.
--We've searched for over 1.5years to find the right fit
--We did inspections pre-COVID so we know the house is solid.
--Motivated seller's who already came down 30k on price making this a below market value bargan.
--Already spent ~1k on inspections for this place.
--House prices have so far remained stable and this lot (a few acres within commuting distance to an urban center) is likely to increase in value, even in a recession.

I'm encouraging my husband to enroll in trucking school while laid off so he has a recession-resistant income stream to support this purchase. He is concerned about public exposure risk and is pushing back but I think it's a good idea to invest in ourselves now, house or no house.

I'm essential and have continued to work throughout.

t3_gikjfc,My parents recently became wealthy. What should I do?,"So my parents where already in a really good place financially, but recently through a few shrewd business moves they went from good to great. Since this wasn’t a quick earn I don’t foresee a quick loss on it. Quite the opposite. They have always been the type to keep their money in the bank and live off of dividends, SSI, and one of them still works. 

This latest thing however is a game changer. A real life changing amount of money. It’s got me thinking what that will mean for me later in life. Me and my spouse do just fine and make 120k or more in a year.  So In no way am I wishing my parents dead.  I do ok with money. I’m not the greatest and have had to have a few bailouts in my life. But it’s something I’m actively learning to improve. 

I know that one day I will come in to a significant inheritance because they will not spend all this money. I don’t want to screw it up. I don’t want to spend it all on myself that I leave nothing for my own children one day. 

Is there anything I should do?  My parents are pretty open with me about investments and stuff but I don’t get too nosey. It’s not my money yet after all, and truly I want them to just live comfortably and happy as long as they can.   I just don’t want to one day have it dropped in my lap and do something stupid.

I'm a union member who went from the field to a more office environment due to my injury. My wife and I live in a condo that we got for $130,000 dollars, we didn't want to be house poor. My wife is a stay at home mom, until out 2 year old starts preschool. We do plan on sending him to a private school. Our car payments are about $700 dollars combined. We plan on paying one of them off in a year. We have one credit card that we pay off completely every month. That's our debt. 

Through the union, my employer pays for my families health insurance and they pay for our pension.

My heart tells me to pay off the cars and by myself a lightly used one with cash. I'd keep it around $25,000. After paying off the other car payments and buying a car, that would leave me with about 10k. I would no longer have a car payment, and my wife and I would have vehicles that could last us years.

t3_gi922x,Should I keep this Metlife whole life insurance policy my parents set up for me in 1995? Or put cash value into ROTH?,"I am looking at a 5 year old document sent by Metlife for a ""Life Paid up at 98"" insurance policy my parents set up when I was a baby. First I need to find out and confirm that is a whole life plan and not a term life plan. I'm having trouble making the distinction. Seems pretty darn whole life to me.  Apparently they're still paying premiums into it. I don't understand it exactly/how it helps *me* down the line. 

Some details I'm seeing (I need to get myself into the account online to see current data, standby):

* Face Amount of Insurance: $30,000
* Annualized Premium $172.80 ($14.40/mo)
* Total Current Death Benefit: $31,182
* Total Current Cash Surrender: $1663

Now that I'm older and interested in making wiser financial decisions I'm looking at this and questioning the validity in keeping it. I am behind but recently got my Roth IRA Target Fund 2060 started and maxed it out for the year. I am currently unemployed and penny pinching, trying my best to make best decision with what dollars I have now for the future.

Obviously if I die I want my parents to be beneficiary of something. I can name them on my Roth IRA or maybe create a term life?

My question is this--&gt; I'm apparently *that* more or less ""deep"" into this Metlife policy. Should I liquidate what little cash value I can get out of it and dump that into my ROTH for 2019 or should I /my parents keep paying into this?

The whole concept of it confuses me. I know my parents wanted what's best as an investment for me and I'm not sure the Metlife plan, specifically, is it. But I also don't want to foolishly dump something I shouldn't. I have read much on here that these plans are gimicky at best, but not always. Not sure where I fall. Help me educate please.

t3_ghy8mc,Is it irresponsible for me to quit my job due to the high stress of working full-time while being a decent parent and teacher?,"**Summary:** Hoping for objective feedback on whether it is fiscally responsible for me to consider temporarily leaving the workforce to be a more present parent/teacher and improve my own mental health. Total income reduction would be \~40%.

I want to acknowledge from the start that I know we're very privileged to be able to consider this option. Also, our school district is known for being woefully underfunded and ill-prepared for anything outside of the ordinary, so unfortunately we just can't count on a plan that will actually be supportive of working parents. The resources we've been provided to date suggest a six-hour cobbled-together ""curriculum"" of websites, and as full-time working parents that's just not reasonable. Again, recognizing our privilege here and acknowledging that a lot of parents are dealing with the same thing and have no choice but to continue to muddle through.

**All the context:** I have been in my field for over a decade in a few different companies (never less than three years at any) and at increasing levels. I've built solid connections, and the field I'm in now is not in danger of decline. However, my current employer is in an at-risk industry, though in a growth niche of that industry and doing quite well before COVID-19. I work for HQ and have solid job security relative to other positions, but a month ago the company did lay off 25% of total HQ staff (including open positions) and us survivors took a 10% pay cut. The company is doing everything possible to stay relevant and grow revenue within current constraints, but due to the industry there is a lot out of anyone's control (so there's a fair chance more cuts are on the horizon, and work will continue to consolidate to those who remain).

I don't love what I do, but I'm good at it, am respected, and have curated valuable connections at different companies. However, with all the ambiguity of COVID-19 my job has become more stressful than ever. As the SME people depend on me for a lot, and the amount of requests and projects I'm being pulled into is excessive, but necessary. Meanwhile, I also have a young child in elementary school, and neither my spouse nor I have been able to devote enough time to effectively continuing his education beyond relying on Khan Academy and the like and doing a hands-on science experiments maybe once a week.

Given the high stress of my job, the marketability of my field, and the fact that school and childcare very likely won't be any kind of ""normal"" at least through the end of 2020, I'm seriously considering leaving my job and looking for something new next year. I could likely take an unpaid FMLA leave, but realistically I know that's not enough time, and I know I wouldn't want to return after taking time off.Pros to quitting: Dedicated time to spend with the kid, less stress for my spouse so he can more fully focus on work, head space for me to give some actual thought to whether I even want to continue in my field or pivot to something else, and greatly decreased stress.Cons: \~40% decrease in household income, potential difficulty re-entering job market, additional stress on my spouse being the ""breadwinner"". My spouse grew up lower-middle class and is nervous about the prospect of giving up my income.

This plan is tight, but we have savings if an unexpected expense comes up. It does not account for contributions to my retirement, though we could fund an IRA for 2020. It also does not account for contributions to other savings vehicles, like the 529 education savings account for our son (his account currently has \~$10k in it). If necessary we could cut further in food and entertainment. Not planning any travel obviously.I'd plan to return to work early/mid-2021.

t3_gi2gbp,SO fell victim to a scam. Is there anything that can be done at this point?,"SO tried to purchase some products overseas from a ""supplier"". After she made the initial purchase ~$200 USD, they then claimed she needed to pay money ($200 + $500) to get it through ""Customs"" and to process some paperwork. They were supposedly sending the products with a delivery guy. 

Today, they claimed that they could not refund any amount below $2000. 

She's asked for her money back, but she's getting bogus claims from the sales person (of course)

She's called Western Union, but the transaction has been complete. So I'm assuming nothing can be done there. 

She's also filed a claim with her bank, but I'm not sure that will be if much help. 

Is there anything else that can be done here? 

Thanks in advanced.

t3_gi8g5u,(CH) Going over credit card limit but paying back by end of the month?,"Hello, I've recently got my first credit card which I needed to complete off purchases of various items I needed to start living on my own parents free. I have a stable income and a job however I still needed the credit card to purchase some things as I had to pay a physical cash insurance for the place I now rent.

In doing so I've currently running on fumes till the end of the month, with no effective money in my bank till next paycheck and credit card going over the limit. Now I've gotten my first bank statement that counted the period where it didnt go through over the limit, they set a minimum to pay off and gave me a date of 30th may. 

Now my question is this, I was able to go over the limit as of yesterday I think, all of my purchases are now just for food to get to the next paycheck, once I get it I can clear off everything. Is it normal to be able still to pay for stuff even if I went over the limit and how bad it is if I I will pay the over the limit amount + about 1/3rd of my actual limit on 28th, when I get the paycheck. 

I'm not breaking any law am I?

t3_gjnlbs,Refinancing Process,"I’m in Wyoming. And I’m pursuing a refinance through an online company.

When I started the process, I picked a closing cost amount and an annual percentage rate.

For over a month now, every week my closing costs increase. I went from 2k to 3k to 5k and now 7k.

I locked in a rate at the start, but now I’m starting to pay points in my closing costs. I feel as if my closing costs are being adjusted to give me my “locked in rate”.

Are ballooning closing costs normal?

t3_gjned9,"Finally maxing out my SEP IRA (as an employee), now what?","Like the title says, I am now financially able (thanks to paying off my student loans!) to put the max $6K into my SEP IRA I have through work.  I want to make clear that I am not self-employed nor the employer, but an employee and am limited to the normal $6K of standard IRAs.

Since I do not have access to a 401K, where do I go from here in terms of saving for retirement?  

I had never really looked into or considered my options until now because of my loans and I am finding it all more difficult than I expected.  A little background to help. I am 30 and married.  My husband currently maxes out his IRA and his 401K.  He invests from there.  He has suggested I open a brokerage account and invest as well.  I'd prefer something a little more set it and forget it because this really isn't my thing.
